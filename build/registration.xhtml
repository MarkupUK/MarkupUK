      <h1>Register now!</h1>
      
      <p>To register, <a href="https://exist.sgmlguru.org/exist/rest/apps/MUK-reg/registration-form.xhtml">click here!</a> You will be asked to enter your personal details — note that name, email, and country of origin are required fields — and then be redirected to PayPal. Note that <strong>you do not have to register on PayPal</strong>, you can pay with a credit card without logging in.</p>
      <p>Early-bird registration closes on 26th of April.</p>
      
      <p class="lead"><b>Issues Registering?</b></p>
      <p>We've had a few reports about difficulties when registering. Here's what <strong>should</strong> happen:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Fill in your registration details in the <a href="https://exist.sgmlguru.org/exist/rest/apps/MUK-reg/registration-form.xhtml">form</a> and hit <strong>Register</strong>. A summary page opens, listing the details you gave, AND (important!) a large, yellow PayPal button.</li>
        <li>A click on the PayPal button opens a popup window with a PayPal payment page. If this doesn't happen, check your browser settings - you need to allow popups!</li>
        <li>When you've completed paying through PayPal, you'll be directed back to a thank you page. You'll also receive a confirmation email with an invoice attached.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>If some of this doesn't happen, please <a href="mailto:info@markupuk.org">drop us a line</a> and we'll sort it out!</p>

      <p>If you live in a country other than the UK, you should not pay UK VAT. Current EU regulations move the responsibility for the recording of a VAT transaction from the seller to the buyer for that good or service. When registering, you'll be given the opportunity to register your country of origin and avoid paying UK VAT.</p>
      <p><strong>Note that you may be expected to pay VAT in your own country.</strong></p>
