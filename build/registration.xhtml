    <h2>2020 Conference Registration Is Closed</h2>
    <p class="lead">Due to the extraordinary circumstances, we've had no option but to cancel this year's conference. Registration is therefore closed.</p>
    <p>Those of you who already registered will, of course, be refunded in full. We will contact you as soon as possible for further details. If you have any questions or comments, please <a href="mailto:info@markupuk.org">let us know</a>.</p>
    <p>Thank you for your interest and support, and please stay safe.</p>

      <h1>Registration Is Now Open!</h1>
      
      <p>To register, <strong><a href="https://exist.sgmlguru.org/exist/rest/apps/muk-reg/registration-form.xhtml">click here!</a></strong> You will be asked to enter your personal details — note that name, email, and country of origin are required fields — and then be redirected to PayPal. Note that <strong>you do not have to register on PayPal</strong>, you can pay with a credit card without logging in.</p>
      <!--<p>The conference will be all virtual this year. We'll send you a URL and login details a few days before the conference begins, so make sure that the email address you provide is correct!</p>
      
      <p>The registration fee is £50, with students registering at £20.</p>-->
      
      <p class="lead">Participating Remotely</p>
      <p>For those of you who can't travel to London in June, we are offering an <strong>online attendance option</strong> - we'll stream the conference proper (Friday and Saturday) via Zoom. We'll be able to allow questions from the online audience (but the social dinner is out of the question as we've yet to perfect the art of emailing food and drinks to attendees).</p>
      
      <p class="lead"><b>Issues Registering?</b></p>
      <p>In case of difficulties, here's what <strong>should</strong> happen:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Fill in your registration details in the <a href="https://exist.sgmlguru.org/exist/rest/apps/muk-reg/registration-form.xhtml">form</a> and hit <strong>Register</strong>. A summary page opens, listing the details you gave, AND (important!) a large, yellow PayPal button.</li>
        <li>A click on the PayPal button opens a popup window with a PayPal payment page. If this doesn't happen, check your browser settings - you may need to allow popups!</li>
        <li>When you've completed paying through PayPal, you'll be directed back to a thank you page. You'll also receive a confirmation email with an invoice attached.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>If some of this doesn't happen, please <a href="mailto:info@markupuk.org">drop us a line</a> and we'll sort it out!</p>

      <!--<p>If you live in a country other than the UK, you should not pay UK VAT. Current EU regulations move the responsibility for the recording of a VAT transaction from the seller to the buyer for that good or service. When registering, you'll be given the opportunity to register your country of origin and avoid paying UK VAT.</p>
      <p><strong>Note that you may be expected to pay VAT in your own country.</strong></p>-->
      
      <p><strong>We've had to update the registration app to always charge VAT, as the guidelines from HM Revenue &amp; Customs are far from clear. Any questions? <a href="mailto:info@markupuk.org">Drop us a line</a> and we'll share the confusion!</strong></p>
