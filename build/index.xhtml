        <h2>The Call for Papers Is Now Open</h2>
        <p><a href="speakers.html">The call for papers</a> is now open and it's time to start thinking about that paper.</p>
        
        <h2>2021 Conference Dates Announced</h2>
        <p>Markup UK is pleased to announce that the next edition of the conference will take place from <strong>Friday 21st to Saturday 22nd May 2021</strong>.</p>
        <p>Given the continuing global situation, the conference will take place in hybrid form: there will be a physical presence at a venue (we will confirm where asap) in London, with the option to attend virtually.</p>
        <p>Importantly, registration will be flexible, allowing attendees to change between virtual and physical, as circumstances dictate. Similarly, we intend to prerecord the presentations to make sure our speakers can deliver their talks even if travel proves to be impractical</p> 
        <p>We will publish further details when registration opens, but do contact us if you have any queries via <strong>info at markupuk dot org</strong>.</p>
        <p>We look forward to hosting our fourth year's conference and to welcoming attendees both new and from previous years.</p>

        <p class="lead">2020 Conference Cancelled</p>
        <p>Due to the extraordinary circumstances, we've had no option but to cancel this year's conference.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the ever-increasing risks associated with the widespread coronavirus have led us to a decision that, although appropriate under these unique circumstances, undoubtedly will be disappointing to many. This year's conference has been cancelled and we'll be working towards returning in 2021.</p>
        <p>Those of you who already registered will, of course, be refunded in full.</p>
        <p>Thank you for your interest and support, and please stay safe.</p>
