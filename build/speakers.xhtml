    <h2>2020 Conference Paper Submission Is Closed</h2>
    <p class="lead">Due to the extraordinary circumstances, we've had no option but to cancel this year's conference.</p>
    <p>We'll be working towards returning in 2021 so hold on to those paper ideas, but for now, <a href="https://www.balisage.net/">Balisage</a>, our upcoming sister conference, is your best bet to meet like-minded markup practitioners and theoreticians.</p>
    <p>Thank you for your interest and support, and please stay safe.</p>

    <h1>Call for Papers Now Open!</h1>
    <p class="lead">This Year's Theme Is <strong>The Future of Distributed Markup Systems</strong>!</p>
    <p>The events of the past year have impacted all our lives significantly, including the way we work. Against this backdrop, we might ask ourselves: what role have markup technologies played?</p>
    <p>We'd like to hear about:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>the challenges that confronted you under changed circumstances</li>
      <li>what worked, what didn't work so well (and indeed, what stayed the same)</li>
      <li>emerging trends in markup systems prompted by lockdowns and increased home-working, and how you see these developing in future.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We of course remain interested in other good-quality markup stories.</p>
    
    <!--<p class="lead">Preconference Slots Available</p>
    <p>Do you have an idea for a preconference tutorial or workshop, or would you like to organise a preconf meetup for your favourite markup technology? We have <strong>four 90-minute slots</strong> available and would very much like to hear from you. <a href="mailto:submit@markupuk.org">Drop us a line</a> with your topic, a rough outline, the intended target audience, and any other information you think we should know about, and we'll be more than happy to consider your idea.</p>-->

        <h1>Oxygen Authoring Tool</h1>
          <p class="lead">Not everyone loves writing their paper in emacs!</p>
          <p>If only there were a freely available online editor, which:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Is beautiful and intuitive to use</li>
            <li>Understands and writes native XML</li>
            <li>Produces and checks the appropriate DocBook XML format</li>
            <li>Allows on-the-fly PDF previews</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Well, there is now!  And because it's provided by SyncroSoft, you can also clone, edit, and generate the PDF previews directly in Oxygen XML Editor.</p>
          <p></p>
          <!-\-<h2>Using the online editor</h2>
            <p>Simply <a href="https://github.com/oxygenxml/markupuk-2019-paper/blob/master/fork.md">follow these instructions:</a></p>

            <p>Note that the "Deploy to Netlify" button on that page will clone the original repository for you.</p>
          <h2>Running locally</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Deploy the online editor, above; if you don't want to do so, you can also <a href="https://github.com/oxygenxml/markupuk-2019-paper">clone the project locally</a>.</li>
