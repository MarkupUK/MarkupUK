    <h1>2023 Call for Papers</h1>
      <p class="lead">This year's theme is markup quality assurance.</p>
      <p>Markup itself, of course, is about adding semantics and precision to content, allowing us to author, process, and publish information faster while avoiding the pitfalls of the many manual tweaks necessary in unstructured word processing. But automation is not without its problems:</p>
      
      <ul>
          <li>How do we express quality in markup? What is "good" markup? Or "bad", for that matter?</li>
          <li>How do we ensure quality at the end point of a transform?</li>
          <li>How do we measure the correctness of an iXML grammar?</li>
          <li>How do we test the impact of changes to a processing pipeline?</li>
          <li>(etc)</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>But remember, markup is not just XML. How do you measure quality in Markdown documents? JSON? YAML? Have we learned anything since SGML?</p>
      
      <p>As always, we welcome any markup-related abstract of interest - markup QA is an important area for us all, but by no means the only one.</p>
      
      <!--<p>We'd like to see extended abstracts, long and detailed enough to give us an understanding of what your paper and presentation will be about, or, if you so prefer, a full paper.</p>
      
      <p>Abstracts can be submitted using the <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=muk23">EasyChair conferencing system, located at https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=muk23</a>.</p>-->
      
      <p>Abstract submission is now closed. What you should do instead is to check out the <a href="schedule.html">programme</a> and <a href="registration.html">register</a>.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">Syd Bauman became a hard-core computer user in 1982, and a devotee of descriptive markup two years later. He learned about OHCO and SGML in 1985 (yes, before it was published). He began using SGML and the TEI when he came to the Women Writers Project (then at Brown University) in 1990. He is now a member of the <a
                                    href="https://dsg.neu.edu/">Digital Scholarship Group</a> in the <a

                                            href="https://library.northeastern.edu/">Library</a>, where he serves as the Senior XML Programmer/Analyst for the <a
                                    href="https://wwp.northeastern.edu/">Women Writers Project</a>, one
                                of the oldest <a href="https://tei-c.org/">TEI</a> projects in
                                existence. Although his title would have you believe that he is a
                                computer programmer, Syd is fond of pointing out that he doesn't
                                write that much actual code; when he does it is usually in XSLT, and
                                his programs are always copylefted. Syd has served as the co-editor
                                of the TEI Guidelines, and on the TEI Technical Council. He
                                occasionally provides XML, TEI, and XSLT consulting for digital
                                humanities projects, and often teaches workshops on XML, TEI, and
                                XSLT.</p>

In a previous life, she wrote code for systems that put ink on paper and used, taught, and documented an early 1980's proprietary generic markup system named “SAMANTHA”.

    <h1>Call for Papers Now Open!</h1>
    <p class="lead">This Year's Theme Is <strong>The Future of Distributed Markup Systems</strong>!</p>
    <p>The events of the past year have impacted all our lives significantly, including the way we work. Against this backdrop, we might ask ourselves: what role have markup technologies played?</p>
    <p>We'd like to hear about:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>the challenges that confronted you under changed circumstances</li>
      <li>what worked, what didn't work so well (and indeed, what stayed the same)</li>
      <li>emerging trends in markup systems prompted by lockdowns and increased home-working, and how you see these developing in future.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We of course remain interested in other good-quality markup stories.</p>
    
    <p>We are thinking about prerecording some or all of the presentations to minimise the risk of technical mishaps during the conference. We still expect you to be available for questions after the talk, of course.</p>
    
    <p>Note that we're NOT going to make any recorded presentations available after the conference, nor will we keep said recordings. We've been considering the idea after experiencing first-hand the realities of online presentations during the past year, but also because when Markup UK 2021 was still to happen in hybrid format, it was a simple way of ensuring that the show can go on, regardless of last-minute changes to the global situation.</p>
    
    <!-\-<p class="lead">Preconference Slots Available</p>
    <p>Do you have an idea for a preconference tutorial or workshop, or would you like to organise a preconf meetup for your favourite markup technology? We have <strong>four 90-minute slots</strong> available and would very much like to hear from you. <a href="mailto:submit@markupuk.org">Drop us a line</a> with your topic, a rough outline, the intended target audience, and any other information you think we should know about, and we'll be more than happy to consider your idea.</p>-\->

        <h1>Oxygen Authoring Tool</h1>
          <p class="lead">Not everyone loves writing their paper in emacs!</p>
          <p>If only there were a freely available online editor, which:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Is beautiful and intuitive to use</li>
            <li>Understands and writes native XML</li>
            <li>Produces and checks the appropriate DocBook XML format</li>
            <li>Allows on-the-fly PDF previews</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Well, there is now!  And because it's provided by SyncroSoft, you can also clone, edit, and generate the PDF previews directly in Oxygen XML Editor.</p>
          <p></p>
          <!-\-<h2>Using the online editor</h2>
            <p>Simply <a href="https://github.com/oxygenxml/markupuk-2019-paper/blob/master/fork.md">follow these instructions:</a></p>

            <p>Note that the "Deploy to Netlify" button on that page will clone the original repository for you.</p>
          <h2>Running locally</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Deploy the online editor, above; if you don't want to do so, you can also <a href="https://github.com/oxygenxml/markupuk-2019-paper">clone the project locally</a>.</li>
