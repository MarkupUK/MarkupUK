        <h1>Instructions for Authors</h1>
        
        <h2>What we would like</h2>
        <p>We invite submissions from presenters who would like to share their work with other members of the markup community. We welcome proposals from all, regardless of their level of expertise or experience: the one essential aspect of
your submission is that it is in some way relevant to markup and/or related technologies.</p>
        <p>We are always keen to encourage submissions from first-time presenters and newcomers to either the conference or the wider markup community. We strive to create a welcoming and accepting environment that is also as diverse and
representative as possible.</p>
        
        <h2>What you need to do</h2>
        <p>If you would like to submit a proposal, we require as a minimum an <strong>extended abstract of no fewer than 500 words</strong>. (It's not so hard - it's the same as this page.)</p>
        <p>This document should outline what you will be presenting and give reviewers a clear indication of the <q>story</q> you intend to tell. You do not have to go into detail at this stage - although it is fine if you do - but your proposal stands a better chance of being accepted if there is enough substance for reviewers to gauge the relevance of the topic and the quality of the material.</p>
        <p>The typical slot at the conference lasts 40 minutes, consisting of c.30 minutes of presentation followed by around 5 minutes for questions from the audience. Shorter slots are also available, so if you feel you would need less time, please make sure to indicate this when submitting your proposal.</p>
        
        <h2>How to submit your proposal</h2>
        <p>You should submit your proposal document [<a href="https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=muk25">https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=muk25</a>] by 14th March 2025 at the latest, also stating the desired length of your slot. To aid in anonymous reviewing, please also ensure as far as possible that there is nothing included in your submission that would easily identify you.</p>
        
        <h2>The process</h2>
        <p>When the call for papers closes, submissions are assigned to the conference Programme Committee, who review them and provide feedback to the organisers. We then pass this information on to you as authors and, if your proposal is accepted, any constructive suggestions the reviewers have for improvements.</p>
        <p>Authors whose submissions are accepted then have a few weeks until 23rd May 2025 to prepare their paper as a valid DocBook article. This helps us to prepare the proceedings in time for the first day of the peer-reviewed portion of the conference 5th June 2025. We provide an &lt;oXygen/&gt; editing framework [INSERT LINK] to help you in this task.</p>
        
        <h2>Why you should do it</h2>
        <p>Sharing your ideas and validating your work with your peers is never a bad thing. Your contribution matters!</p>
        <p>Speakers also receive free admission to the entire three days of the conference.</p>
        
        <h2>Any questions?</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions about any aspect of the submission process, or would like to discuss a potential proposal with us, please do not hesitate to contact us at <a href="mailto:info@markupuk.org">info@markupuk.org</a>.</p>
        <p>We look forward to receiving and reviewing your proposals!</p>
