      <h1>2025 Call for Papers</h1>
      <!--<p class="lead">This year's theme is, well, markup!</p>
      
      <p>In previous years, we've suggested themes, ideas and topics focussing on some area of interest within markup, hopefully making a potential presenter's job easier while, at the same time, providing the conference with a coherent, overarching story. 2023's theme, for example was markup quality assurance, a topic as important now as it was two years ago.</p>
      
      <p>But the fact is that themes in later years have seldom proved to be key; they are simply not as useful as they once were. XML, for example, entered mainstream a long time ago. Other markup languages followed; JSON, for example, has its uses and the question <q>should we use JSON in place of XML?</q> surely is no longer relevant. Etc.</p>
      
      <p>So, what should you talk about at Markup UK? Well, for starters, do you agree? Or do you think XML failed, as a paper presented at a sister conference once claimed? Do you think markup should be invisible? Is markup dying? Is the future of markup in AI? Or would you rather focus on the community aspects, say, about how to bring in new blood to the field?</p>
      
      <p><a href="https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=muk25"><strong>Let us know.</strong></a></p>-->

            <p class="card-text">Lingunixtix is a typesetting linguist and connaisseur of free software
                    with small memory, cpu and carbon footprints. From his point of view
                    xml languages are languages, too and large and complicated document
                    processing systems may look like newly invented squared wheels to
                    him. Lingunixtix never leaves house without Occam's razor and seeks to
                    reduce unnecessarily complex systems by an order of magnitude, or
                    two. His credo is "Sine necessitate entia non sunt multiplicanda" –
                    Without need things must not be multiplied. And "Those who do not
                    understand Unix are condemned to reinvent it, poorly." (Henry Spencer,
                    programmer)

            <p class="card-text">Daniel Arthursson, CEO CloudBackend</p>
            <p class="card-text">Daniel Arthursson created his first XML parser in C++ in 1996. Then went on to the create an XML/Application Server in 1998 (similar to php, but development 100% in XML). He then did the architecture of a XML-based Content Management Systems (CMS) based on the XML Application Server. Then he started the work on the XIOS/3 Edge Application Platform, initially intended to be a Client Application Server that shifted execution from the cloud to web browsers. The work of CloudBackend and its architecture started as a complement to XIOS/3 with the intent of being the backend data storage capability of a traditional application server and database.</p>
            <p class="card-text">Some of these learning was applied to build the iCloud.com service, which Daniel founded. It included cloud storage and productivity applications and many of his previous learnings. Apple acquired iCloud in 2011 and Daniel continued to build the CloudMe.com cloud/sync storage service. The work with CloudTop, the XML OS, which is another invention from Daniel, is something that has been going on in parallel over the years.</p>
            <p class="card-text">In 2018 XIOS/3 and CloudBackend became their own companies and what is the modern versions of these long-term research projects started to see its day. CloudTop has been migrated into these new platforms over the last couple of years for a potential future relaunch.</p>
            <p class="card-text">A red thread of what Daniel has been doing over the last 26 years is to build and innovate technology that makes as much use of XML as possible. He has also been teaching XML to many larger enterprises in Sweden through several educational companies.</p>

            <p class="card-text">Michael Kay spent the first 25 years of his career working in total obscurity on billion-dollar projects within the (then) UK computer manufacturer ICL. So he's well aware that most of the XML action occurs well out of the gaze of the internet public, and that the impact of a technology like XML or XSLT continues to grow long after it has lost its youthful sex appeal. Hopefully some of the people doing unseen mega-projects with XML are in the audience today. </p>
            <p class="card-text">He moved into the limelight when he was asked to take on the job of editing the W3C XSLT 2,0 specification in 2002, and then went on to set up Saxonica in 2004, imagining that this might be an enjoyable way to spend a few years before retirement. 20 years on, retirement is as far off as ever. When the W3C activity on XSLT and XPath closed down after completing XSLT 3.0 in 2017, he felt there was unfinished work to be done, and this led eventually to the creation of a Community Group to develop a 4.0 specification. That group has been highly active over the last year, and this talk will describe the current state of its specifications - which are very much work in progress, despite the fact that experimental implementations of new features appear regularly in new Saxon and BaseX releases. </p>
