            <h5 class="card-title">Michael H Kay</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Michael Kay spent the first 25 years of his career working in total obscurity on billion-dollar projects within the (then) UK computer manufacturer ICL. So he's well aware that most of the XML action occurs well out of the gaze of the internet public, and that the impact of a technology like XML or XSLT continues to grow long after it has lost its youthful sex appeal. Hopefully some of the people doing unseen mega-projects with XML are in the audience today.</p>
            <p class="card-text">He moved into the limelight when he was asked to take on the job of editing the W3C XSLT 2,0 specification in 2002, and then went on to set up Saxonica in 2004, imagining that this might be an enjoyable way to spend a few years before retirement. 20 years on, retirement is as far off as ever. When the W3C activity on XSLT and XPath closed down after completing XSLT 3.0 in 2017, he felt there was unfinished work to be done, and this led eventually to the creation of a Community Group to develop a 4.0 specification. That group has been highly active over the last year, and this talk will describe the current state of its specifications - which are very much work in progress, despite the fact that experimental implementations of new features appear regularly in new Saxon and BaseX releases.</p>
