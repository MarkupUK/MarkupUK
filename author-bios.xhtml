                            <p class="card-text">Syd Bauman became a hard-core computer user in 1982, and a devotee
                                of descriptive markup two years later. He learned about OHCO and
                                SGML in 1985 (yes, before it was published). He began using SGML and
                                the TEI when he came to the Women Writers Project (then at Brown
                                University) in 1990. He is now a member of the <a

                                existence. Although his title would have you believe that he is a
                                computer programmer, Syd is fond of pointing out that he doesn't
                                write that much actual code; when he does it is usually in XSLT, and
                                his programs are always copylefted. Syd has served as the co-editor
                                of the TEI Guidelines, and on the TEI Technical Council. He
                                occasionally provides XML, TEI, and XSLT consulting for digital
                                humanities projects, and often teaches workshops on XML, TEI, and
                                XSLT.</p>
