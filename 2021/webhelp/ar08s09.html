            With diff3x, we can integrate more modern structure-aware comparison tools and represent
            choices that are consistent with the structure and more likely to provide well-formed or
            valid results. </p><p>We have considered the representation of nested changes but concluded that the
            additional complexity to the diff3x format is unlikely to be worth the small gain. </p><p>The diff3x format can take plain text as its payload. If the payload is XML it would
            need to be escaped for example with CDATA and treated as text. We considered whether, if
            the payload is also XML, this could be treated as XML and although this is possible we
            concluded that treating an XML payload as text has the advantage that tag changes and
            attribute changes can be represented directly in situ. Our experience with XML tools and
            technologies has allowed us to develop XML-centric resolvers, but these have the
            limitation that they do not work with JSON and other non-XML formats. They still have
            benefits and their applications, for example when considering nested change or n-way
            merge. As such they complement the benefits of diff3x.</p><p>In a related paper [<a class="biblioref" href="bi04.html#git-prague" shape="rect">5</a>] we identified some issues in version
            control systems that caused inconsistency and confusion to users. One solution to those
            issues relies on separating the merge driver from subsequent conflict resolution tools
            or 'merge tools'. The diff3x format proposed here would work well for data exchange
            between these two steps. This is important because it separates knowledge of the format
            and structure of a file from a GUI designed to allow the acceptance of changes or the
            resolution of conflict thus enabling a single GUI to handle many different file
            structures in a consistent way.</p><p>The intention of diff3x is to provide a richer format than diff3 for the exchange of
            differences and conflicts in text files. The advantages of diff3x over diff3 include the
            following:</p><p>
            </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Recording user selections of options: this provides both the facility to
                        save changes during a merge resolution session and providing an audit record
                        of the choices made.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Connected options: this provides the ability for the selection of one
                        option to trigger the selection of another connected option, e.g. when a
                        start tag is selected the corresponding end tag is also included.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Auto include of text: this provides for certain text to be automatically
                        included if certain options are selected, e.g. so that appropriate
                        separators could be included.</p></li></ol></div><p>
        </p><p>We have shown that improvements to the representation of change for structured data is
            possible and desirable. Changing the existing diff3 format proved to be awkward and
            limited, so this move directly to a markup representation using XML is a better
            approach. In working this through in more detail in this paper we have identified other
            advantages to make it easier for users to accept or reject changes in a way that is
            consistent with the underlying structure of the data.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><span class="navprev"><a accesskey="p" href="ar08s08.html" shape="rect">Prev</a></span> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="u" href="ar08.html" shape="rect">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> <span class="navnext"><a accesskey="n" href="bi04.html" shape="rect">Next</a></span></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="h" href="oxygen-main.html" shape="rect">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td></tr></table></div><div class="footer">Generated by<a class="oxyFooter" href="http://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_webhelp.html" target="_blank" shape="rect">
