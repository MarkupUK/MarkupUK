      just “it works” or “it’s fast”. Most software, only throw
      away scripts are probably exempt, goes through a life cycle of writing, testing debugging and
      maintenance. </p><p>This makes it important that what you write is comprehensible, both for somebody else and
      yourself in a few months’ time (or less). It is not just a matter of being nice: intelligible
      code, being able to easily grasp what is meant, reduces the chance of mistakes and bugs, and
      shortens development time.</p><p>Nobody is in the business of deliberately writing puzzling code. But given what we
      probably all encounter now and then, there is a lot of jigsaw software in the world. What is
      this XSLT trying to do? Why the <span class="emphasis"><em>%$#^</em></span> is this XQuery not properly
      indented, so I can see what <code class="code">else</code> belongs to what <code class="code">if</code>? What does this
      variable store and what’s its type? What am I supposed to pass to this parameter? </p><p>We all forget to pay attention to these kinds of things. We were hurried, hungry,
      caffeine-depleted, tired, or stressed. We thought this piece of software would be thrown away,
      but it miraculously survived for many, many years. We were in a flow and wanted to see an
      end-result quickly. Even although we knew that a little attention now would save many, many
      hours of maintenance and bug-hunting later, we did not pay enough attention.</p><p>So, what we can do about it? We have probably all seen, heard, or read something about how
      to write good code. We probably all to try to comply, more or less, but given what we see
      around us, we do not always succeed. We are <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> the computers we program;
      our head contains a different kind of CPU and we must deal with that. </p><p>This talk will try to provide directions, tips and tricks on how to make code more
      understandable. It will also provide some background on why this important and why we should
      try to comply, despite all the excuses we give ourselves every day. How can we do this with
      minimum effort. It’s a mixture of things from literature and personal experience after
      40 years of programming computers.</p><p>Comprehensible code is not something specifically for XML alone, so the applicability is
      therefore wider. Examples will be for XML programming languages. </p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><span class="navprev"><a accesskey="p" href="ar05.html" shape="rect">Prev</a></span> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="u" href="ar05.html" shape="rect">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> <span class="navnext"><a accesskey="n" href="ar05s01s01.html" shape="rect">Next</a></span></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="h" href="oxygen-main.html" shape="rect">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td></tr></table></div><div class="footer">Generated by<a class="oxyFooter" href="http://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_webhelp.html" target="_blank" shape="rect">
