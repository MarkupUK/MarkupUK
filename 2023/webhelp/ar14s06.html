    the point of this paper is to describe the philosophy of making tools,
    so we will take a different approach, and describe its evolution.</p><p>In the first instance, the author needed to identify structural
    differences between two versions of the JATS DTD. This is a fairly
    large vocabulary, and two organizations that needed to interchange
    documents each had made their own variation on it.</p><p>The first version of Eddie 2 used a DTD parser module in Perl;
    the XML support in Python at the time did not seem to report
    DTD events such as finding element or entity declarations. The first version took a few hours to write and get working satisfactorily.</p><p>Once Eddie 2 was producing useful output, and could handle
    parameter entities more helpfully than other dtd-diff tools, the
    next step was to generate an XSLT stylesheet to handle each element
    that might appear in the input, simply copying it to its output and
    producing a message that it had been seen.</p><p>Including this XSLT and processing the sample documents available meant that the most frequently-occurring elements could be handled first;
    this meant the number of validation errors in the output reduced
    very quickly.</p><p>Since Eddie 2 made an HTML report, it was easy to add to this
    a list of elements that were in a configuration file Eddie 2 read,
    and to highlight whether the elements had the same content model and
    attributes in both DTDs, or whether they differed.</p><p>This list, shown on the right-hand side in Figure <a class="xref" href="ar14s06.html#fig-eddie21" title="Figure 5. Eddie 2 Report" shape="rect">Figure 5, “Eddie 2 Report”</a>,
    can also be used as a sort of to-do list: any elements that differ
    between DTDs and are not handled in the XSLT or in the configuration
    file are marked with a red X. Eddie 2 also reads the XSLT file to
    check for coverage, and warns if there are such elements with no template
    to match them in the main stylesheet.</p><div class="figure" id="fig-eddie21"><p class="title"><strong>Figure 5. Eddie 2 Report</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="80%"><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><img src="papers-2023/quin/images/eddie21.png" width="100%" alt="Eddie 2 Report" /></td></tr></table></div></div></div><br class="figure-break" clear="none" /><p>The Eddie 2 tool has proven to be highly effective in helping
    people write this sort of transformation between similar DTDs.
    Because it depends on some Perl modules, it can be a little tricky to
    install; a replacement written entirely in XSLT is waiting for a
    project to come along and fund its completion.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><span class="navprev"><a accesskey="p" href="ar14s05.html" shape="rect">Prev</a></span> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="u" href="ar14.html" shape="rect">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> <span class="navnext"><a accesskey="n" href="ar14s07.html" shape="rect">Next</a></span></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="h" href="oxygen-main.html" shape="rect">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td></tr></table></div><div class="footer">Generated by<a class="oxyFooter" href="http://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_webhelp.html" target="_blank" shape="rect">
