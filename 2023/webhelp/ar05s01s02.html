It is based on <span class="productname">XProc</span> (1.0), which became a <span class="orgname">W3C</span> recommendation in 2010. Based on user experience, a group of volunteers have worked together since 2017 as an <span class="orgname">W3C</span> community group to improve and expand the original language. In September 2022, a community report on the core language specifications and the standard step library was published. While additional step libraries, e.g. for file processing, document validation, and paged media creation, are technically still under construction, we consider them to be very mature and in their final state. In fact, the project presented here relies heavily steps from the additional libraries, and they proved to be very useful and robust.</p><p>For those familiar with the original <span class="productname">XProc</span>, it might be interesting to mention some of the changes made for <span class="productname">XProc 3.0</span>. The most visible change is the expansion of the basic document model from <acronym class="acronym">XML</acronym> only to a more realistic model for the latest processing: “Native” documents in <span class="productname">XProc 3.0</span> are now <acronym class="acronym">XML</acronym>, <acronym class="acronym">HTML</acronym>, <acronym class="acronym">JSON</acronym>, as well as text documents and binary documents (such as images or <acronym class="acronym">PDF</acronym>s). The newly supported document types are accompanied by corresponding steps so that they can be used effectively in the pipelines. Further highlights of <span class="productname">XProc 3.0</span> are the move to <span class="productname">XPath 3.1</span> as the underlying processing language, <span class="productname">XDM</span> typing for options and variables along with a number of minor syntax tweaks that greatly improve the coding and debugging experience from the original <span class="productname">XProc</span>.</p><p>For those not familiar with <span class="productname">XProc</span> 1.0, or those who want to start over with <span class="productname">XProc 3.0</span>, there is now an improved learning base. Foremost, there is <span class="personname">Erik Siegel</span>'s excellent book [<a class="citation" href="references.html#d5e1457" shape="rect"><span class="citation">Siegel:2020</span></a>]. Erik also published a series of articles introducing <span class="productname">XProc 3.0</span> on <span class="orgname">XML.com</span> ([<a class="citation" href="references.html#d5e1446" shape="rect"><span class="citation">Siegel:2019</span></a>], [<a class="citation" href="references.html#d5e1468" shape="rect"><span class="citation">Siegel:2020a</span></a>], [<a class="citation" href="references.html#d5e1479" shape="rect"><span class="citation">Siegel:2020b</span></a>]). For those who prefer videos, a series of six talks from <span class="orgname">Markup UK 2020</span> are available on the conference's <span class="orgname">YouTube</span> channel. In addition to two talks on the basics of <span class="productname">XProc 3.0</span>, there are also talks on handling JSON documents, text documents and Zip archives.</p><p>Currently, two <span class="productname">XProc 3.0</span> processors are known to be available: <span class="productname">XML Calabash 3.0</span> is in its final phase as a successor to the well-known <span class="productname">XML Calabash</span>, both developed by <span class="personname">Norman Tovey-Walsh</span>. This paper is based on <span class="productname">MorganaXProc-III</span>, which is the successor to the now retired <span class="productname">MorganaXProc</span>. Also developed by <span class="orgname">&lt;xml-project /&gt;</span>, this is a <span class="productname">Java</span> (or <span class="productname">JVM</span>) based implementation that, in addition to the core specification and the standard step libraries, also implements the file step library and most of the validation library, while also supporting <span class="productname">Extensible Validation Report Language (XVRL)</span>. It has been around as a public beta since February 2020, received a lot of useful bug reports from users and was released as version 1.0 in September 2022. Since then, it has received monthly updates with bug fixes and feature enhancements. <span class="productname">MorganaXProc-IIIse</span> is an open-source product released under GPL 3.0. Coming later this year is a second, commercial edition called <span class="productname">MorganaXProc-IIIee</span> (Extended Edition). It provides support for almost all optional features of <span class="productname">XProc 3.0</span>, with complete coverage of the proposed step libraries as well as processor-specific steps such as image processing.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><span class="navprev"><a accesskey="p" href="ar05s01s01.html" shape="rect">Prev</a></span> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="u" href="ar05s01.html" shape="rect">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> <span class="navnext"><a accesskey="n" href="ar05s02.html" shape="rect">Next</a></span></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="h" href="oxygen-main.html" shape="rect">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td></tr></table></div><div class="footer">Generated by<a class="oxyFooter" href="http://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_webhelp.html" target="_blank" shape="rect">
