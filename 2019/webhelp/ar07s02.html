It explains how the two two-way diffs are aligned. It is
            useful to understand this in order to see how it might affect tree-structured
            data.</p><p>The example consists of three text files with numbers on each line, A, B and the 'old'

            <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="papers-2019/robin/MarkupUK2019-submitted2/tables.png" /></span></p><p>The last three columns show how the two diffs are combined. Note that the yellow match
            shows where all three files align. This alignment is important because it is the data
            between these alignment points that are considered as units of change. Now we can look
            at the diff3 output using the -m
            option:</p><pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">1

6</pre><p>This output shows that the '4 5' sequence has been accepted as the only possibility
            between the '1' and the '2', but between the '2' and the '6' we have three possible
            choices, which are listed in the output. We do not want to get diverted into a
            discussion about alignment algorithms, nor whether or not this is appropriate for
            tree-structured data. The point here is that the positions in the files at which they
            all three align are considered 'anchor' points, and all of the data between is
            considered to be a choice - and when there is some kind of conflict, the choice is left
            for the user to select. </p><p>There is an interesting consequence of this structure: it is not possible to have two
            consecutive choices without a separator that is due to a commonality between all three
            files, i.e., an anchor point. Although for structured data it would be natural, for
            example, to provide choices about attributes in a manner that allows each attribute to
            be chosen separately, the diff3 format dictates that two adjacent changes are seen as
            one choice. For structured data such as XML, it may be possible to get round this by
            artificially creating anchor points that are white space which is not relevant to the
            result. However, this is not ideal, partly because diff3 would not create such
            artificial anchor points and, therefore, the subsequent change to the layout of the
            files would not be expected by the user.</p><p>The diff3 format provides a way to delineate the three choices, though not all of them
            may be present. Each choice is independent of any other choice, and there is no
            connection between them. This independence presents a problem for tree-structured data
            because there is a dependency between, for example, inserting a start tag and inserting
            the corresponding end tag; unless these insertions are done as a single choice, the
            result will not be well-formed. This problem can always be overcome by duplicating some
            of the data, and the argument here is very similar to that presented at this conference
            last year regarding change to both content and structure [<a class="xref" href="bi07.html#Overlapping" title="When Overlapping XML Meets Changing XML Does Confusion Reign?" shape="rect">4</a>]. Duplication can work well when the span of the change is small because very little
            data needs to be duplicated, but when the span is larger, more data needs to be
            duplicated and the nature of the change is lost in this duplication. In the extreme,
            duplication of the entire contents of an XML file will always yield a choice between
            well-formed fragments because each fragment is the entire file. This is correct but, of
            course, of little practical use.</p><p>We will look at some examples of changes to attributes where we can, with some
            manipulation of the data, present choices where the selection of any one of the two or
            three choices will provide a well-formed result.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><span class="navprev"><a accesskey="p" href="ar07s01.html" shape="rect">Prev</a></span> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="u" href="ar07.html" shape="rect">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> <span class="navnext"><a accesskey="n" href="pres.html" shape="rect">Next</a></span></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="h" href="oxygen-main.html" shape="rect">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td></tr></table></div><div class="footer">Generated by<a class="oxyFooter" href="http://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_webhelp.html" target="_blank" shape="rect">
