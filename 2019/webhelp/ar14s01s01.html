				combination of prose and an SGML DTD.  In this sense, and one
				other (see XHTML later in this paper) HTML shares some ancestry
				with XML However, people working with XML and with HTML often
				have very different ways of looking at markup. The difference
				can be illustrated by the meaning of the word
					<span class="quote">“<span class="quote">semantics</span>”</span> in the respective communities. In
				the HTML world, it’s common to hear people to describe the
				meaning of an element in terms of what a Web browser does when
				it encounters the start and end tags. Although most browser
				developers no longer refer to start and end tags as separate
				commands, the idea remains that operational semantics, Web
				browser behaviour, is the primary focus of HTML design. Marking
				up in the sense of identifying the content of a document seems
				alien here: there’s no <span class="emphasis"><em>poem</em></span> element, for
				example, and tie <span class="emphasis"><em>cite</em></span> element has no
				standard way to identify the author of a quotation or to give a
				bibliographic reference.</p><p>HTML offers some extensibility: one can use markup such
				as:</p><pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">&lt;span class="volno"3&lt;/span&gt;</pre><p>to indicate the issue number of a volume containing a journal
				within a bibliographic reference. As with <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">plain
					XML</span>”</span> there is no standard way to mark up a
				bibliography and one is actually more likely in practice to find
				simply</p><pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;</pre><p>in practice, or, worse,</p><pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">&lt;span class="cn506dw"3&lt;/span&gt;</pre><p>inserted by a content management system, framework, or word
				processor conversion.</p><p>IHTML 5 includes elements such as <span class="emphasis"><em>nav</em></span> and
					<span class="emphasis"><em>main</em></span>, but their goal is to help people
				and programs navigate round documents by identifying the
				functions of different parts, not to try and label the parts and
				have the browser automatically function appropriately.</p><p>HTML, then, is strongest when the Web is the primary end
				output format. It should be mentioned that there are also
				products that support generating PDF for print from HTML and
				CSS, and that the EPUB 3 standard uses XHTML (with a move to
				HTML possible in the future).</p><p>A difficulty with HTML can be that the content can be
				difficult to reuse or re-purpose. If you do the work to annotate
				your HTML so that audiobooks can be made, or to use
					<span class="emphasis"><em>class</em></span> attributes consistently enough
				that your aircraft repair manual can be generated automatically
				from your twenty-thousand-page operations manual, you will be
				replicating the work that might already have been done for you
				with an SGML or XML system: the tools are not generally designed
				for large, long, complex documents with precise domain-specific
				requirements. <span class="bold"><strong>The primary application
					domain and usage context of HTML is the Webb
					browser.</strong></span></p><p>A <span class="emphasis"><em>benefit</em></span> of using HTML, however, can be
				reduced staff training. If your writers are already familiar
				with HTML, they can be up and running quickly. Beware, however,
				that saving a few hours of training does not end up costing you
				weeks or months of work when you discover the files are not
				consistently marked up or contain errors that weren’t flagged by
				(error-tolerant) HTML systems or Web browsers.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><span class="navprev"><a accesskey="p" href="ar14s01.html" shape="rect">Prev</a></span> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="u" href="ar14s01.html" shape="rect">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> <span class="navnext"><a accesskey="n" href="ar14s02.html" shape="rect">Next</a></span></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="h" href="oxygen-main.html" shape="rect">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td></tr></table></div><div class="footer">Generated by<a class="oxyFooter" href="http://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_webhelp.html" target="_blank" shape="rect">
