            comparison tools with the existing diff3 format so that there is minimal change for
            users. We have shown that by laying out comparison results for structured
            representations such as XML or JSON, we can make them easier to process and more likely
            to provide well-formed or valid results. We have shown that there are limitations, in
            particular the representation of connected changes, where some more intelligence in the
            diff format is needed to ensure the result is well-formed. Nested changes can also be
            represented with amendments to the diff format, but this is more complicated and is
            likely to be easier using XML rather than a variant of diff3.</p><p>Even if these things are possible, that does not necessarily mean we should go down this
            route. It is worth considering some of the history and how we got here. Early version
            control systems were in use with 24 line, 80 column VDUs and with editing tools such as
            vi and emacs. In those days, developers intimately understood the representation and
            manipulated it directly. We are now used to using IDEs that directly support version
            control operations in their graphical user interfaces. In many cases, these interfaces
            hide the change markers that we have been discussing and instead present the user with
            side-by-side alternatives and GUI control buttons to resolve differences. We could
            consider the display of the diff3 style change-markers akin to the concept of 'tag
            display' modes in word-processors and XML editors. In many of these systems, either it
            is impossible to see any underlying markup or it is a feature for advanced (or perhaps
            'older'?) users that needs to be explicitly turned on, with the growing trend for the
            default being to hide the markup from the user. Is there a similar trend with change and
            conflict markers? This implies that the actual syntax used to represent the changes and
            conflicts is less important than it used to be, and there is less need to try to
            preserve it.</p><p>In our recent paper [<a class="xref" href="bi07.html#git-prague" title="Merge and Graft: Two Twins That Need To Grow Apart" shape="rect">5</a>], we identified some issues in version
            control systems that caused inconsistency and confusion to users. One solution to those
            issues relies on separating the merge driver from subsequent conflict resolution
            tools or 'merge tools'. In pursuit of the best way forward, we have further explored
            these possibilities and we have implemented the layout approaches discussed earlier.</p><p>We have shown that improvements to the representation of change for structured data is
            possible and desirable. Changing the existing diff3 format is awkward and limited, so it
            might be better to move directly to a markup representation using XML because the text
            will not be directly edited by users and mature tools are available to process the XML.
            Arguably it would be simpler to avoid these issues and present users with a merge user
            interface that understood structured content and provided operations which preserved the
            well-formed nature or validity directly. However, the value of a standard format for
            such conflicts and changes is that the merge tool is primarily a GUI and the user can
            choose the merge algorithm and the merge tool independently.</p><p>We have presented this paper to explore these ideas, but we are not suggesting that the
            best approach is extending or enhancing the current diff3 representation. An XML
            alternative to diff3 would have some advantages and should be explored as a longer-term
            improvement for representing and processing conflicts and changes in structured
            data.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><span class="navprev"><a accesskey="p" href="ar07s05.html" shape="rect">Prev</a></span> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="u" href="ar07.html" shape="rect">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> <span class="navnext"><a accesskey="n" href="bi07.html" shape="rect">Next</a></span></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="h" href="oxygen-main.html" shape="rect">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td></tr></table></div><div class="footer">Generated by<a class="oxyFooter" href="http://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_webhelp.html" target="_blank" shape="rect">
