			PostScript language which, when executed, produce page images, ODF
			and OOXML are XML representations, again binary and compressed but
			extractable as text. However, rather than specifying the position of
			items on the page, ODF and OOXML provide an XML-based representation
			of editable documents.</p><p>Word processors generally are strong in their tools for commenting
			on documents and performing collaborative reviews. The model is that
			a reviewer sends an annotated copy of a document to the author, who
			then in turn reviews the comments and suggested changes; this model
			fits well with many social contexts of writing and working with
			documents.</p><p>The ODF and OOXML formats were designed to serialize OpenOffice
			and Microsoft Word™ documents (respectively) to XML, and support
			document revision. Unlike PDF, ODF and OOXML documents are intended
			to be editable by the recipient, and text reflows.</p><p>Unfortunately, the OOXML specification, despite being very large,
			is also incomplete. In addition, the XML is written in the
			word-processing implementation domain, not in the user’s problem
			domain. The XML is complex and relatively difficult to work with,
			although freely available libraries and XSLT transformations exist
			to work with them. Word processor formats tend not to nest
			structures very much: for example, list items tend to be considered
			as automatically-numbered paragraphs and not to be nested inside a
			containing list element. Points at which there had one been style
			changes or selection boundaries may also be retained in the markup,
			further complicating processing.</p><p>Word processing files are not generally ideal for archiving or
			interchange except in specific contexts such as the need for review
			or specific print-based workflows. Generated HTML may also have
			accessibility problems, and unless users are systematic with the use
			of named styles there tends to be only weak semantic labeling. Word
			processors in many cases reduce the apparent cost of writing,
			because they make it seem easy. Unfortunately in a wider context
			this can merely result in increasing costs and complexity elsewhere
			in workflow processes when finer-grained control over markup and
			document features may be needed. In this regard, word processor
			files can be similar to HTML documents. In all cases final archived
			documents need to be saved in format that is independent of any
			particular version of any software.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><span class="navprev"><a accesskey="p" href="ar14s11.html" shape="rect">Prev</a></span> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="u" href="ar14.html" shape="rect">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> <span class="navnext"><a accesskey="n" href="ar14s13.html" shape="rect">Next</a></span></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="h" href="oxygen-main.html" shape="rect">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td></tr></table></div><div class="footer">Generated by<a class="oxyFooter" href="http://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_webhelp.html" target="_blank" shape="rect">
