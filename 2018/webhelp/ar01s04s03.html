Intuitive markup is like intuitive user interfaces, a lovely but very fragile environment-based fiction.</p><p>Familiarity with one markup vocabulary often influences others. In the last 25 years or so, HTML has become such a well-known vocabulary that many users don’t think of it as a set of tags that someone made up and that have grown over time. Many users think of the HTML tags as <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">natural</span>”</span> in some fashion. So, they think it is <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">natural</span>”</span> to use &lt;p&gt; for paragraphs and &lt;li&gt; for list items. Even odder, they think it is <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">natural</span>”</span> to have different wrapper tags for numbered and unnumbered lists but to distinguish between numbered and lettered lists with an attribute. I’m not saying that this doesn’t work; clearly it does. But there is nothing more <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">natural</span>”</span> about this than, for example, having a single list wrapper element and distinguishing between unordered, numbered, and lettered display with an attribute. Users have objected to using unfamiliar tags for familiar structures; we already know HTML, we should use HTML tags when possible. </p><p>More insidious, we already know the logical model that underlies HTML so well that we think of it as the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">natural</span>”</span> model of text. HTML does not allow lists inside paragraphs. Therefore, even in the case where a list occurs inside a sentence, which continues after the end of the list, where the list is obviously inside the paragraph, we should encode that as two paragraphs with a list between them, because HTML would have to code them that way. I have been astonished by users who were shocked by the suggestion that in their content they might allow lists to occur inside paragraphs instead of between them!</p><p>Of course, we get push-back in the other direction, too. A comment on JATS recently suggested that the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">rather old fashioned HTML style (&lt;i&gt;,&lt;b&gt;), e.g. &lt;bold&gt;, &lt;italic&gt;</span>”</span> tags be replaced by tags such as  &lt;emph&gt; or &lt;hi&gt; <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">that at least try to encode the ‘meaning’ of the tagged content</span>”</span>. This, in my opinion, is simply a stylistic suggestion: &lt;i&gt;, &lt;italic&gt; and &lt;emph type="italic"&gt; carry exactly the same amount of semantic information!  The suggestion was to use a more familiar or more comfortable tag set, not to increase the semantic richness of the vocabulary.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><span class="navprev"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s04s02.html" shape="rect">Prev</a></span> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="u" href="ar01s04.html" shape="rect">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> <span class="navnext"><a accesskey="n" href="ar01s05.html" shape="rect">Next</a></span></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="h" href="oxygen-main.html" shape="rect">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td></tr></table></div><div class="footer">Generated by<a class="oxyFooter" href="http://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_webhelp.html" target="_blank" shape="rect">
