                and help them to design what the project delivery will look like. Following the
                migration of the Knowledge Warehouse data several other data sets for the same
                airline were also migrated to S1000D. These migrations were many times easier to
                perform thanks to the lessons learned from the original project. Perhaps the single
                most important way that these migrations were different is that the decision making
                was completely handed over to the customer. Rather than the implementation team
                taking the source data and trying to reproduce it in S1000D, the customer decided
                exactly what the S1000D would like when the migration was complete. To facilitate
                this a list of documents to be migrated was made and placed in a spreadsheet. The
                customer then decided what publication, chapter and section the document would
                appear in when migrated. They also decided what the technical name and information
                name of each document would be, what the SNS number would be, what model
                identification and system difference codes would be used. So that ultimately they
                knew exactly what to expect when the content was migrated. This also allowed the
                implementation team to highlight any potential problem areas before the migration
                started. Using this approach was extremely successful, to the extent that the
                customer knew exactly what to expect. In fact when viewing the content
                post-migration it appeared so exactly to match their expectation that they had to be
                persuaded to conduct thorough acceptance testing! “What’s the point?” they said “it
                looks perfect!”. In fact, of course, it wasn’t perfect and a few changed did need to
                be made but nothing compared to the restructuring that had to be done for Knowledge
                Warehouse post-migration.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><span class="navprev"><a accesskey="p" href="ar02s06.html" shape="rect">Prev</a></span> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="u" href="ar02s06.html" shape="rect">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> <span class="navnext"><a accesskey="n" href="ar02s06s02.html" shape="rect">Next</a></span></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="h" href="oxygen-main.html" shape="rect">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td></tr></table></div><div class="footer">Generated by<a class="oxyFooter" href="http://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_webhelp.html" target="_blank" shape="rect">
