languages, for the most part these are "quick" crosswords, whose clues
generally consist of a simple synonym of the target answer <span class="citations">(<a class="link" href="bi04.html#Connor2013" shape="rect">Connor, 2013b</a>)</span>. The first quick crossword is
generally agreed to have been published in New York in 1913; the
British cryptic was an offshoot, first found in the 1930s <span class="citations">(<a class="link" href="bi04.html#Arnot1981" shape="rect">Arnot, 1981</a>)</span>. The cryptic is largely a British
phenomenon; <span class="citations"><a class="link" href="bi04.html#Connor2013web" shape="rect">Connor (2013a)</a></span> suggests that this is partly
attributable to a British taste for "imagery of the nudge-and-wink
variety", toilet humour, and mild profanity, but also to a lack of
other solvers from whom to learn the conventions of the cryptic clue.
Learning how to solve cryptic crossword clues is a matter of practice,
and of learning the rules by which words are encoded into clues
<span class="citations">(<a class="link" href="bi04.html#Stratmann1978" shape="rect">Stratmann, 1978</a>)</span>. In order to understand the
specific markup needs of the CCCP, it will therefore be necessary to
take a brief tour of how target answers may be encoded by cryptic
crossword setters.</p><p>A quick clue for the location of this conference might simply
read "Capital city (6)" (the number in parentheses indicates how many
letters are in the target answer). There are, of course, a number of
capital cities with six letters; the quick-crossword solver relies on
the intersecting words to provide some of the letters needed to narrow
down the possibilities until the correct target is found. The
cryptic-crossword solver, in contrast, should be left in no doubt of
the correct answer, even if there are no intersecting letters
available to confirm it. This is achieved by careful writing of clues
that encode each target answer in two ways.</p><p>The commonest structure for a cryptic clue consists of the
<span class="emphasis"><em>definition</em></span> and the <span class="emphasis"><em>subsidiary
indication</em></span>. The definition provides some kind of synonym or
narrative definition of the target; the subsidiary indication encodes
the target in some other way. A frequent type of subsidiary indication
is the <span class="emphasis"><em>charade</em></span>, in which letters or groups of
letters from the target are clued in sequence in the subsidiary
indication. If we take our "capital city" example, a charade clue
might read as follows: "Left Ontario with DeLillo for UK city" (6).
The clue breaks down as follows: <span class="emphasis"><em>L</em></span>, a common
abbreviation for "left"; <span class="emphasis"><em>ON</em></span>, the postal
abbreviation for "Ontario"; <span class="emphasis"><em>DON</em></span>, the first name
of the American novelist DeLillo. Put together, these fragments
provide the target <span class="emphasis"><em>LONDON</em></span>. "UK city", of course,
is the definition. Notice the words "with" and "for". These are not
mere filler. Each one has meaning in constructing the clue: "with"
indicates that the fragments can be placed together, and "for" is a
common indicator that what follows is the definition of the target. I
will call these types of words "metalanguage".</p><p>The function of the metalanguage is more prominent in this clue:
"City bird around nine doves, initially (6)". Here, the clue's first
word is the definition, and all that follows is the subsidiary
indication. We are looking for a word meaning "bird" which can be
placed around the initial letters of "nine doves". The bird is
<span class="emphasis"><em>LOON</em></span>, and if we place <span class="emphasis"><em>ND</em></span>
between its letters we again arrive at the target
<span class="emphasis"><em>LONDON</em></span>. Again, every single word in the clue
serves a purpose. Finally, let us consider the following clue: "Melon
donut in possession of Julie (6)". Here we need to know that Julie
London was a famous singer, in order to understand that "Julie"
provides the definition component of the clue. The subsidiary
definition is what is known as a "container" type: the letters of the
target are inside ("in possession of") the words <span class="emphasis"><em>meLON
DONut</em></span>.</p><p>These latter two clues show the ambiguity inherent in most
cryptic clues, and how linguistic features are exploited to create
that ambiguity. The apparent noun phrase "city bird" leads the reader
away from the necessary understanding that the split between
definition and subsidiary indication happens between the two words. We
can see, also, that the cryptic crossword setter is permitted to play
fast and loose with punctuation: a more honest punctuation of the clue
as "City: bird around nine doves initially" would make the roles of
the various words clearer. Similarly, the metalanguage in the final
clue is most easily read as suggesting that the donut is in Julie's
possession, whereas the solution requires understanding that "in
possession of" works in reverse here. Either reading is perfectly
syntactically allowable in English, but the more obvious reading is
the wrong one for finding the target answer.</p><p>These examples, I hope, portray a distinctive characteristic of
a well-written cryptic clue: the solver should be left in no doubt
that her answer is correct <span class="citations">(<a class="link" href="bi04.html#Pham2016" shape="rect">Pham, 2016</a>)</span>. The subsidiary
indication makes it clear that no other answer is possible, by
providing specific (albeit heavily encoded) instructions about the
physical makeup of the target answer <span class="citations">(<a class="link" href="bi04.html#Coffey1998" shape="rect">Coffey, 1998</a>)</span>. Not all clues
consist of a definition and subsidiary indication, however. So-called
"double-definition" clues are also popular. These offer two
definitions, incorporated into an apparently single syntactic unit,
which approach the target answer from two different directions. An
example from <span class="emphasis"><em>The Times</em></span> will exemplify this type
of clue: "Alert goalkeeper may dive thus (2, 3, 4)". The answer is "ON
THE BALL", for which "alert" is a synonym, and "goalkeeper may dive
thus" is a descriptive definition. Once the solver has hit upon this
answer, it is quite clear that nothing else will fit the bill; there
is no other phrase that is defined by both of the definitions. Another
example, this time from the <span class="emphasis"><em>Daily Mail</em></span>, shows the
dangers of attempting this type of clue: "Guess there's no proof for
it (10)". The answer, "CONJECTURE", is not particularly obvious. The
two definitions, the synonym "Guess" and the descriptive "there's no
proof for it" could apply to many similar words. It will be
interesting to see whether intuitions about what makes for a good and
a bad clue can be supported by linguistic evidence. For example, it
seems possible that a good double-definition clue needs to have a
certain amount of semantic distance between the two definitions. If
these are too close, there's a risk (as in the Daily Mail example)
that the clue ends up being too broad. It is the intersection of
apparently quite different synonyms or definitions which both apply to
a single target that makes for a good clue.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><span class="navprev"><a accesskey="p" href="ar04s01.html" shape="rect">Prev</a></span> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="u" href="ar04.html" shape="rect">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> <span class="navnext"><a accesskey="n" href="ar04s03.html" shape="rect">Next</a></span></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="h" href="oxygen-main.html" shape="rect">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td></tr></table></div><div class="footer">Generated by<a class="oxyFooter" href="http://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_webhelp.html" target="_blank" shape="rect">
