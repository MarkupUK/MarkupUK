                    or project. To be valid it has to be between 2 and 14 characters long which can
                    include only numbers and upper-case letters. According to the specification,
                    projects must apply to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) Support and
                    Procurement Agency (NSPA) to register an MIC. In practice however, this is more
                    relevant to equipment suppliers and if the data is not going to be exported to
                    other organisations then it should be sufficient to think up a code which is (a)
                    unlikely to be used by anyone else, perhaps by including an organisation name,
                    and (b) which is not one of those already registered. The registered codes can
                    be seen at <a class="link" href="http://www.nspa.nato.int/en/organization/Logistics/LogServ/asds2000m.htm" target="_top" shape="rect">http://www.nspa.nato.int/en/organization/Logistics/LogServ/asds2000m.htm</a></p><p>During the Knowledge Warehouse migration project, the model identification
                    code went through several iterations of change. Initially a very project
                    specific name was chosen but it was soon realised that the project name would
                    become meaningless over time. A thought experiment was carried out to envisage
                    what content might be managed as S1000D in the future. This led to a very
                    high-level name which would cover any content from anywhere within, not only the
                    airline, but its parent company as well. This idea was soon dropped when it was
                    realised that the rest of the numbering system would be exhausted long before it
                    could manage that many documents. In the end a name which was airline specific
                    and signified internal company documents was chosen. If other types of documents
                    from the same airline or documents from other associated organisations were
                    placed in the repository then new model identification codes would be chosen for
                    them.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><span class="navprev"><a accesskey="p" href="ar02s03s01s01.html" shape="rect">Prev</a></span> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="u" href="ar02s03s01.html" shape="rect">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> <span class="navnext"><a accesskey="n" href="ar02s03s01s03.html" shape="rect">Next</a></span></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="h" href="oxygen-main.html" shape="rect">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td></tr></table></div><div class="footer">Generated by<a class="oxyFooter" href="http://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_webhelp.html" target="_blank" shape="rect">
