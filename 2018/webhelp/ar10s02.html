            believe pipeline authors will appreciate the new possibilities of XProc 3.0 so
            much, that they will switch to the new language version as soon as possible. One way to
            describe XProc 1.0 is to say that it is a pipeline language to design workflows
                <span class="emphasis"><em>for</em></span> XML <span class="emphasis"><em>in</em></span> XML. This definition is based
            on the fact, that only XML documents are allowed to flow between the steps that make up
            the pipeline. This feature of XProc 1.0 is most visible in an error message one
            gets to see from time to time when working with XProc 1.0:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>It is a dynamic error (XD0001) if a non-XML resource is produced on a step output
                or arrives on a step input.</p></blockquote></div><p>Please note that this is dynamic error number 1. Although this error message is
            sometimes annoying, it clearly states the nature of XProc. XProc was invented and
            developed with the goal to be able to specify <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">a sequence of operations to be
                performed on a collection of XML input documents.</span>”</span> Of course the creators of
            XProc knew that there are not only XML-documents, so there was a section on "Non-XML
            documents" in the original specs. This section is about thirteen lines and makes a
            distinction between almost-XML documents (HTML) and non-XML documents. For the first
            there is the ability to turn it into XML, and for the second a mechanism is presented,
            to let them <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">flow quietly through the pipeline</span>”</span>: The non-XML document is
            either converted into text or base64-encoded and wrapped in an element node with a
            document-node, which means it now <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">can be processed like any other XML
                document</span>”</span>.</p><p>This was of course an elegant way to deal with non-XML documents in XProc, but it also
            meant that these documents can only "go with the flow". XProc itself defines no steps
            for these documents, the only interesting things you could do with them is to send them
            to a web service or store them on your disk, provided they are not base64-encoded or
            your XProc processor implements the optional feature of decoding base64-encoded
            documents before it stores them. Of course you could store them anyway, but storing a
            base64-encoded JPEG wrapped in an XML element does not count as interesting, does
            it?</p><p>And as this situation became unpleasant, different mechanisms were invented to go
            around it. Steps were invented to deal with ZIP archives because we all know, that
            sometimes XML documents are packed into ZIP or should be packed into ZIP. But as ZIP
            documents could not flow through a pipeline themselves and although they may contain
            flowable XML-documents, they typically encapsulate a lot of stuff that could not flow
            with a pipeline. This is particularly problematic if you going to pack a ZIP, have a lot
            of XML-documents to put in, but also need some images and/or a text document.</p><p>To invent a workaround they probably looked at ANT and did what ANT does: Read and/or
            write to the file system. So unpacking a ZIP reads a file from the file system and
            creates a lot of files with the unpacked content on another place in the file system.
            Some steps just read from the file system but produce an XML-document that flows in the
            pipeline, e.g. XMLCalabash's extension step <code class="literal">cx:metadata-extractor</code>
            which reads an image and produces an XML-document containing the image's metadata. Other
            steps take XML-documents as input but write their non-XML result to the file system,
            like XProc's extension step <code class="literal">p:xsl-formatter</code> which typically produces
            PDF.</p><p>Some of these steps are really handy, some are mere workarounds. But from a purist
            perspective they are all workarounds because XProc is designed to be a language where
            documents flow between ports, and reading and/or writing to file systems is clashing
            with the style. But even if you do not share a puristic approach to language design,
            there are some problems with this approach:</p><div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style=""><li class="listitem"><p>As your intermediate results are written to the file system, you have to
                        remember to delete them, once they are no longer needed.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Writing to the file system might sometimes also be dangerous because an
                        incautiously designed pipeline could overwrite some (or even all) vital
                        documents on your file system with its intermediate results.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Sometimes it's not even handy, e.g. when you have to write a ZIP-archive to
                        the file system and then read it again because you want to send it to some
                        web service from the pipeline.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>From an implementer's perspective the read-/write-approach of steps has
                        the disadvantage, that the connection between input- and output-ports is not
                        the only thing to take into account, when the execution plan for a pipeline
                        is to be determined. Since a step might need to read from the file system
                        the results another wrote there, this establishes a connection between the
                        steps too. I think this is one of the reasons why no implementation ever
                        fulfilled XProc's promise yet, that a pipeline could be split up in parallel
                        processes running side by side on our multi-core computers.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Finally: Did I mention JSON yet?</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><span class="navprev"><a accesskey="p" href="ar10s01.html" shape="rect">Prev</a></span> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="u" href="ar10.html" shape="rect">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> <span class="navnext"><a accesskey="n" href="ar10s03.html" shape="rect">Next</a></span></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="h" href="oxygen-main.html" shape="rect">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td></tr></table></div><div class="footer">Generated by<a class="oxyFooter" href="http://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_webhelp.html" target="_blank" shape="rect">
