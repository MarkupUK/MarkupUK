                    or upper-case letters) separated by dashes. The first group of two or three
                    characters is the system code, the second group, rather confusingly, has one
                    character for the sub-system and another for the sub-sub-system code and the
                    final group of two or four characters is the assembly code, e.g. XX-XX-XX or
                    XX-XX-XXXX</p><p>Once again component manufacturing shows its strong influence on the
                    specification. One way to make sense of this is to think of the three groups in
                    terms of chapter, section and subject. The Knowledge Warehouse content already
                    had a number of top level headings which could be thought of as chapters, which
                    themselves were divided into sections, so this seemed at first a straightforward
                    mapping. It also highlighted an important point, which is the relationship
                    between the content in the repository and what is seen by the viewer. While
                    S1000D advocates a modular approach, meaning content can be re-used anywhere, it
                    is also important to consider that authors need to be able to locate the content
                    quickly in the CSDB. Having a numbering system that means something is one way
                    to achieve this. If an author knows they want to edit a procedure and all of the
                    procedures are in chapter 1 which has a SNS starting 01 then this makes locating
                    the content in the repository much easier than if a randomly allocated number is
                    used. It was also discovered that having to consider a new numbering system
                    prompted a rethink of how the airline’s engineering content was structured. For
                    example, several chapters contained a section on health and safety. While some
                    of this content could be re-used in a modular way, some was unique to the
                    context of the chapter. It was decided to use the same section number to signify
                    health and safety in each chapter so that authors knew immediately where to find
                    health and safety content, as shown below:</p><p>01-02-XXXX – Health and safety section in chapter 1</p><p>02-02-XXXX – Health and safety section in chapter 2</p><div class="table" id="table6"><p class="title"><strong>Table 5. A word of advice..</strong></p><div class="table-contents"><table xml:id="table6"><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">With hindsight, perhaps it would’ve been even better to put all
                                Health and Safety content under a common code, maybe using HS as the
                                system identifier and forgetting about the chapter context all
                                together. In truth, there are many different and equally valid ways
                                to organise content in S1000D and in the end it is for those who
                                will be using the system to decide what works for them.</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><br class="table-break" clear="none" /><p>Another important factor to consider is allowing space for the content to
                    grow. For this reason it was decided quickly to use 4 characters for the
                    assembly (or subject) code so that no artificial constraints were created early
                    on in the project.</p><p>Similar restrictions exist on the total number of chapters and sections
                    available, depending on whether it is decided to use numbers only or letters as
                    well. Whatever system is chosen it is important to ensure that there is plenty
                    of growing room at every level.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><span class="navprev"><a accesskey="p" href="ar02s03s01s03.html" shape="rect">Prev</a></span> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="u" href="ar02s03s01.html" shape="rect">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> <span class="navnext"><a accesskey="n" href="ar02s03s01s05.html" shape="rect">Next</a></span></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="h" href="oxygen-main.html" shape="rect">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td></tr></table></div><div class="footer">Generated by<a class="oxyFooter" href="http://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_webhelp.html" target="_blank" shape="rect">
