under-theorized from almost any relevant linguistic standpoint
<span class="citations">(<a class="link" href="bi04.html#Pham2016" shape="rect">Pham, 2016</a>)</span>.
Two papers by semioticians stand out
as contributions to the understanding of the genre <span class="citations">(<a class="link" href="bi04.html#Greimas1967" shape="rect">Greimas, 1967</a>;
<a class="link" href="bi04.html#Vantu1991" shape="rect">Vântu, 1991</a>)</span>, as does a
recent corpus-linguistic analysis of crossword puzzles as a distinct
register <span class="citations">(<a class="link" href="bi04.html#Pham2016" shape="rect">Pham, 2016</a>)</span>. Articles examining the linguistic
playfulness and ambiguity of cryptic clues may be added to these as
examples of introductory explorations <span class="citations">(<a class="link" href="bi04.html#Cleary1996" shape="rect">Cleary, 1996</a>; <a class="link" href="bi04.html#Coffey1998" shape="rect">Coffey, 1998</a>; <a class="link" href="bi04.html#Rambousek2004" shape="rect">Rambousek, 2004</a>)</span>. Beyond this, many papers
published about crosswords (whether quick or cryptic) tend to be
psychological investigations of crossword solvers' intelligence or
other cognitive abilities, or the role of crosswords (and other
puzzles) in cognitive development and in preventing cognitive decline
<span class="citations">(e.g. <a class="link" href="bi04.html#Underwood1994" shape="rect">Underwood, 1994</a>; <a class="link" href="bi04.html#Lewis2006" shape="rect">Lewis, 2006</a>; <a class="link" href="bi04.html#Friedlander2009" shape="rect">Friedlander, 2009</a>; <a class="link" href="bi04.html#Nickerson2011" shape="rect">Nickerson, 2011</a>; <a class="link" href="bi04.html#Moxley2015" shape="rect">Moxley, 2015</a>; <a class="link" href="bi04.html#Friedlander2016" shape="rect">Friedlander, 2016</a>)</span>. The other common type of paper
is the description of computational approaches to writing or solving
crossword clues <span class="citations">(e.g. <a class="link" href="bi04.html#Williams1979" shape="rect">Williams, 1979</a>; <a class="link" href="bi04.html#Smith1986" shape="rect">Smith, 1986</a>; <a class="link" href="bi04.html#Littman2000" shape="rect">Littman, 2000</a>;
<a class="link" href="bi04.html#Hardcastle2007" shape="rect">Hardcastle, 2007</a>)</span>.</p><p>Could it be that the paucity of linguistic analyses of the
cryptic crossword can be attributed to a lack of interesting
linguistic features? After all, an entire puzzle's worth of crossword
clues contains relatively few words in total, and there is little
discursive linkage between individual clues. In the terms defined by
the foundational text-linguistic work by <span class="citations"><a class="link" href="bi04.html#HallidayHasan1976" shape="rect">Halliday (1976)</a></span>, a set of cryptic crossword
clues lacks <span class="emphasis"><em>texture</em></span>: the network of linguistic
relationships between sentences that makes a coherent
<span class="emphasis"><em>text</em></span>. A set of clues is a set of fragments, but
not a text.</p><p>Nevertheless, a number of authors have argued for the merit of
the cryptic crossword as an object of linguistic study. From the
perspective of semiotics, <span class="citations"><a class="link" href="bi04.html#Greimas1967" shape="rect">Greimas (1967)</a></span> suggests that the
crossword should be analysed on the same terms as other types of
aesthetic "communication différée" (p. 799) (<span class="emphasis"><em>delayed
communication</em></span>). By this, he means uses of language (like
poetry) which are non-direct, and which necessitate a process of
decoding in order to achieve communication between the creator (known
as the "setter" of a cryptic crossword) and the audience. He notes
that the absence of grammatical predicates in French crossword clues
is the type of feature upon which a typology of the genre might be
built. Since the predicate carries many of the temporal specifics of a
sentence, as well as indicating the role of elements such as subject
and object, it is no surprise to find that the lack of a predicate is
also a feature of the English cryptic clue. <span class="citations"><a class="link" href="bi04.html#Stratmann1978" shape="rect">Stratmann (1978)</a></span> calls attention to the
relationship between the cryptic clue's encoding of meaning and the
literary tradition of Lewis Carroll and James Joyce. He links the
success and complexity of the cryptic crossword clue to specific
linguistic features of English, calling attention to the abundance of
short words and the lack of mandatory inflectional endings, aspects of
the language that make flexible clue-writing much easier. Indeed,
<span class="citations"><a class="link" href="bi04.html#Connor2013" shape="rect">Connor (2013b)</a></span> argues that English is "the best
crosswording language" (p.114) as a result of its large vocabulary and
rich range of synonyms (the result of large-scale borrowing from other
languages over more than a millennium). The cryptic crossword clue
benefits from the range of potential ambiguity residing in English
syonyms, as well as in the comparative lack of grammatical specificity
that <span class="citations"><a class="link" href="bi04.html#Stratmann1978" shape="rect">Stratmann (1978)</a></span> identifies. In an uninflected
language like English, it is no doubt easier to have a word that looks
like (say) a noun, but is intended by the setter as a verb; there are
few required word-endings that would give the game away. </p><p>Genre-theoretical approaches to the crossword have also been
successfully attempted. <span class="citations"><a class="link" href="bi04.html#Vantu1991" shape="rect">Vântu (1991)</a></span>, in an exploration of
Romanian crossword clues, argues that they may best be analyzed as
wordplay or as jokes. <span class="citations"><a class="link" href="bi04.html#Cleary1996" shape="rect">Cleary (1996)</a></span> calls English cryptic crosswords
"exercises in constructed ambiguity" (p.15). Like Vantu, he sees in
them a source for study of wordplay and linguistic humour, as well as
of the construction and comprehension of meaning. Finally,
<span class="citations"><a class="link" href="bi04.html#Pham2016" shape="rect">Pham’s, (2016)</a></span>
work on register and intertextuality is perhaps
the fullest exploration of the crossword in terms of linguistic
theory. Using a corpus of clues and answers, she argues that the use
of intertextual reference is a distinctive feature of the crossword as
a genre. She also establishes the distinctiveness of cryptic and
non-cryptic crosswords as sub-genres.</p><p>Evidently, there are sufficient grounds for considering the
cryptic crossword as an interesting linguistic object. The Cryptic
Crossword Corpus Project (CCCP) aims to provide a corpus-linguistic
basis for further work on this genre. The project will gather clues
from a range of different publications and crossword compilers,
including the big names such as <span class="emphasis"><em>The Times</em></span> and
<span class="emphasis"><em>The Guardian</em></span>, but also smaller and (perhaps) more
esoteric publications such as the satirical current-affairs magazine
<span class="emphasis"><em>Private Eye</em></span> and the socialist newspaper
<span class="emphasis"><em>Morning Star</em></span>. It may also prove possible to
include clues from cryptic crosswords outside Britain; for example,
<span class="emphasis"><em>The Sydney Morning Herald</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>The
Hindu</em></span> both set a cryptic crossword, as (occasionally) does
<span class="emphasis"><em>The New York Times</em></span>. For the moment, however, the
CCCP will focus on British crosswords.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><span class="navprev"><a accesskey="p" href="ar04.html" shape="rect">Prev</a></span> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="u" href="ar04.html" shape="rect">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> <span class="navnext"><a accesskey="n" href="ar04s02.html" shape="rect">Next</a></span></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="h" href="oxygen-main.html" shape="rect">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td></tr></table></div><div class="footer">Generated by<a class="oxyFooter" href="http://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_webhelp.html" target="_blank" shape="rect">
