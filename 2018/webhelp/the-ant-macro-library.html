    It was clear that continuing to use the existing build process was
    unsustainable, especially as the team was growing and required its
    members to be able to rapidly switch roles within it. Therefore,
    using the Development Policy as the basis for the team’s
    requirements, a new Ant macro library was developed.
  </p><p>
    Although there are many build systems available it was decided to
    keep using Apache Ant for two main reasons. Firstly, it is an XML
    based technology which would be familiar to the team, and secondly
    it would allow the team to re-use parts of the existing build system
    where appropriate. The various Ant macros in the existing build
    system were analysed for common code and functionality and a new
    library constructed using the following principles:
  </p><div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist compact" style=""><li class="listitem"><p>
        Macro definitions would be used rather than custom Java code.
        This would be simpler to maintain and would not require
        additional skills beyond XML.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
        Modular code: related macro definitions would be grouped
        together as files/modules to minimize the number of
        <code class="literal">&lt;include&gt;</code> statements required.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
        Documentation for each of the modules would be included in the
        module itself (as Markdown in the
        <code class="literal">&lt;description&gt;</code> tag, as described above)
        and automatically generated for deployment to an internal web
        site.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
        Common sense naming conventions were followed: for example, the
        file <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">compile-schematron.xml</span>”</span> contains macros
        involved in Schematron compilation and so on.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
        Performance of the build system was not considered to be an
        issue; instead maintainability of the code by the whole team was
        considered to be more important.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
        Additional configuration tools like
        <a class="link" href="http://ant.apache.org/ivy/" target="_top" shape="rect">Ivy</a> and
        <a class="link" href="https://maven.apache.org" target="_top" shape="rect">Maven</a> were
        also not involved, again for simplicity and maintainability
        reasons.
      </p></li></ul></div><p>
    The macros in the library were developed over time but can be
    grouped into a few broad categories:
  </p><div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist compact" style=""><li class="listitem"><p>
        XML operations, such as compiling Schematron files, validating
        XML instance documents and so on.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
        Deployment of files using a variety of mechanisms.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
        Wrappers around shell commands/system executables, such as
        <span class="emphasis"><em>git</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>ssh</em></span> and so on.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
        Utility macros used by other macros.
      </p></li></ul></div><p>
    A number of XSLTs were also developed to work with these macros.
    These generally involved:
  </p><div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist compact" style=""><li class="listitem"><p>
        Extracting Markdown documentation from Ant build files, XSLTs
        and Schematron.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
        Filtering and converting SVRL reports.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
        Modifying Schematron files in a number if ways, for example to
        display report and assert IDs in their respective messages.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
        General utilty stylesheets to modify XML documents in various
        ways (remove documentation elements, linearise XML files etc).
      </p></li></ul></div><p>
    These XSLTs were deployed to a standard location on the CAPE where
    they could be referenced by the Ant macros.
  </p><p>
    It should be noted that most these macros are essentially
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">wrappers</span>”</span> around existing Ant functionality—but the
    value of the Ant library lies in this encapsulation of higher level
    functionality. For example, the <code class="literal">deploy-files</code>
    macro is really just a wrapper around the Ant
    <code class="literal">&lt;copy&gt;</code> task. However,
    <code class="literal">deploy-files</code> is aware of the context within which
    the team is working: team members merely supply a target path on the
    CAPE and a relevant file set and the macro does the rest.
  </p><p>
    This <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">wrapper</span>”</span> pattern has proved very useful in day to
    day use. For example, the standard deploy target for the CAPE is an
    anonymous Samba share hosted on a AWS EC2 Linux instance. This
    allows Ant’s basic <code class="literal">&lt;copy&gt;</code> mechanism (that
    works over file systems) to be used for deployment, as well as
    allowing developers to browse the deployment to check for
    correctness. However, a recently Windows 10 patch removed the
    ability for Windows 10 machines to connect to anonymous shares,
    which meant that those developers could no longer deploy any files.
    To get around this the <code class="literal">deploy-files</code> macro was
    updated to use optionally use <span class="emphasis"><em>ssh</em></span> (Secure
    Shell) as a deployment mechanism. Once the relevant
    <span class="emphasis"><em>ssh</em></span> keys were installed and configured they
    could carry on deploying assets with no changes required to their
    existing build files.
