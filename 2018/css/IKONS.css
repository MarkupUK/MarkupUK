This is an attempt to create svg icons using pure CSS - this allows designers to acheive full separation of content and presentation while retaining control over things like colour fills.

The idea is taken from Noah Blon's blog post here: https://codepen.io/noahblon/post/coloring-svgs-in-css-background-images

This CSS was written by Tomos Hillman for the Markup UK conference at markupuk.org

The icons included are a subset of Piotr Kwiatkowski's 'IKONS' - here is his original README.
