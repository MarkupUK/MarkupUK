    This paper presents a case study on the development of a set of
    standard tools to support and enhance XML based development
    practices in a content delivery team in a major publisher of digital
    information. Originally the team used Microsoft’s Team Foundation
    Server (TFS) as a code repository and
    <a class="link" href="https://ant.apache.org" target="_top" shape="rect">Apache Ant</a> as a
    build tool to perform a variety of XML related tasks, principally
    XSLT and <a class="link" href="http://schematron.com" target="_top" shape="rect">Schematron</a>
    development for a wide variety of types of content with numerous
    internal end users. While TFS is a functional tool it does have
    certain limitations (branching, for example, among others) but was
    not being used in an optimal fashion: the entire code base for all
    projects in all the content teams was included in a single
    repository. Build processes were also poorly documented—as was the
    code and the build files themselves. Deliverable XSLT code was built
    using a complex web of Ant <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">includes</span>”</span> with temporary
    changes being made to certain of these build files by individual
    developers to build the code they needed to deploy at that time.
    Another developer would then make similar modifications to their
    copy for their work. Even worse, the transformation pipelines that
    converted content often ran the code directly from this repository
    so there was no separation between code in a development state and
    code being used in a production environment.
  </p><p>
    In summary then the team was having to work around a number of
    issues:
  </p><div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist compact" style=""><li class="listitem"><p>
        Poor (or non-existent) documentation, leading to long
        on-boarding times before new team members (or existing team
        members changing roles) could become productive.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
        No structured development process, which also led to team
        members unfamiliar with a new project or pipeline taking
        increased time to get useful work done.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
        Poor repeatability of the build process and mechanisms.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
        Lack of a formal (or even notional) deployment phase, leading to
        confusion over which version of code was supposed to be run and
        when.
      </p></li></ul></div><p>
    Although it was not referred to within the team in these terms,
    these seem to be fairly standard <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">DevOps</span>”</span> issues, and
    it was becoming increasingly clear that improvements would have to
    be made.
