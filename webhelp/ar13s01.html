            this work our original objective was to find a way to represent change to structure, and
            this turned out to provide a useful representation for overlapping hierarchy, but with
            the advantage that other changes could also be represented.</p><p>Jeni Tennison says in one of her excellent blogs, "Overlap is arguably the main
            remaining problem area for markup technologists." [<a class="xref" href="bi12.html#Tennison1" shape="rect">1</a>]. She
            points out that this is not only an issue for academics looking at poetry and historical
            documents, but is also an issue in managing change to structured documents. The example
            she cites is legislation which is amended over time where the authors are not concerned
            about changes to structure, their primary interest is in the textual changes.</p><p>There are a number of different approaches to this problem, and some excellent reviews
            of the advantages and disadvantages of the approaches [<a class="xref" href="bi12.html#Overlapping" shape="rect">2</a>] 
            [<a class="xref" href="bi12.html#Overlapping2" shape="rect">3</a>] [<a class="xref" href="bi12.html#Overlapping3" shape="rect">4</a>] [<a class="xref" href="bi12.html#Overlapping4" shape="rect">5</a>].
            Our own goal is to represent changes to documents, such as versions of documents over a
            period of time as they are amended, and to represent them in a way that is easy to
            process. This reflects the classic advantage of XML, where content can be re-purposed to
            meet different needs. If the document can be re-purposed, then we need to be able to
            re-purpose changes also, and this means changes need to be represented in way that is
            easy to process.</p><p>Ignoring for the moment changes to attributes, most changes can be represented by the
            addition and deletion of elements and their content. Additionally, we need to be able to
            mark segments of text that are either added or deleted. This approach allows us to
            represent any change, although not always in an optimal way. For example, in the
            extreme, the deletion of the 'old' document and addition of the 'new' document correctly
            represents the changes, but not in a very useful way. This leads to the observation that
            by duplicating content it is always possible to represent a change in a structured
            document. The problem is that we do not wish to duplicate content because this appears
            to the user as a change to the content, whereas in practice the only change may be to
            the structural markup around that content. This leads to the need to represent the
            addition, deletion, and overlapping of structural elements representing
            hierarchy.</p><p>The TEI format [<a class="xref" href="bi12.html#TEI" shape="rect">6</a>] has powerful, though complex, ways of
            representing different hierarchies, and also variants of text within a document. The
            goal is to provide rich semantic information about the document, representing all of
            this information in a single place. Using this semantically rich representation, it
            would be possible to generate all the different variants of the document, including
            variants of the text and variants of the hierarchy. When we are considering change, it
            is essentially all these different variants that we use as a starting point. Therfore in
            this respect our goal is very similar to, but not quite the same as, the goal of the TEI
            format. As our starting point is a set of document variants, it is natural that we
            clearly identify each of these source variants in the single merged document. We
            therefore always make a very precise differentiation between two overlapping structures,
            because these are considered to have come from different source documents.</p><p>The inherent model that we adopt here, i.e. one that addresses the representation of
            variants of the whole document, is important because it does differ from a model where
            the desire is to represent variants in structure within a document. The latter model can
            lead to a very large number of whole document variants, and our model is not well suited
            to a large number of variants because the attribute values representing the variants
            become long and therefore difficult to manage. Our model addresses primarily overlap in
            the context of change to a document and is not intended as a solution to all overlap
            representation problems.</p><p>Although TEI has these mechanisms, most XML document formats, such as DITA[<a class="xref" href="bi12.html#DITA" shape="rect">7</a>] or DocBook[<a class="xref" href="bi12.html#DocBook" shape="rect">8</a>], do not and would therefore
            benefit from a way of representing overlap. In these formats, overlap representation is
            needed in order to better represent change. There is a clear advantage to having a
            standard way to enhance an existing schema with change and overlap representation
            because structured document editing applications then need to understand only one way of
            handling this. Schmidt [<a class="xref" href="bi12.html#Schmidt2" shape="rect">9</a>] suggests that a good way to manage
            documents that have overlapping hierarchy is to split them into separate documents and
            merge them as needed, though this idea does not seem to have gained a significant
            following.</p><p>There is another distinguishing feature of this solution. In other solutions for
            representing overlap, identifier attributes (which may or may not be strictly of type
            xml:id) are often used to indicate which fragments are part of the same element, but
            with this solution there is no such use of identifier attributes. The problem with using
            identifier attribtues is that it is difficult to denote a fragment that is part of two
            separate hierarchies because only one identifier attribute can be present on each
            element. The identifier attribute could contain a list of identifiers but this does lead
            to make it more difficult to process.</p><p>The representation described here is pure XML. As such, standard XML processing tools
            such as XSLT and XQuery can be used to process it. Each of the original document
            variants can be extracted: this was our primary goal and is an important feature. We
            have verified that it is quite simple in XSLT to extract a single version, and it is
            simple to determine the ancestors of a particular element or piece of text. We are
            currently researching alternative types of processing. One XSLT approach shows
            particular promise for processing n-way comparison results. This uses a template that
            employs sibling recursion and XSLT 3.0 maps, the maps keep track of the state of each
            tree using an extension to the principle of a common stack. </p><p>There are validation rules, which we express in Schematron, for this representation.
            Validation against the original schema of the source documents would need to be done by
            extracting each version and validating it. In other words, we can assert that the
            representation is correct if the Schematron rules are passed and if we can extract each
            of the original documents correctly, i.e. the extracted document is deep equal to the
            original.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><span class="navprev"><a accesskey="p" href="ar13.html" shape="rect">Prev</a></span> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="u" href="ar13.html" shape="rect">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> <span class="navnext"><a accesskey="n" href="ar13s02.html" shape="rect">Next</a></span></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="h" href="oxygen-main.html" shape="rect">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td></tr></table></div><div class="footer">Generated by<a class="oxyFooter" href="http://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_webhelp.html" target="_blank" shape="rect">
