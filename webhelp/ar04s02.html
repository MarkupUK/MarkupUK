      The only one that looked at all promising was a commercial product, 
      Tangible<a href="#ftn.d5e1335" class="footnote" shape="rect"><sup class="footnote" id="d5e1335">[6]</sup></a>. We bought a license 
      to evaluate its capabilities, and the exercise taught us a lot about where the difficulties were 
      going to arise. It was immediately apparent that we would have considerable difficulties with Java 
      generics, with anonymous inner classes, and with our extensive use of the Java <code class="code">CharSequence</code> interface, 
      which has no direct equivalent in .NET. The exercise also taught us that Tangible, on its own, wasn't 
      up to the job. (Having said that, the conversions performed by Tangible helped us greatly in defining 
      our own rules.)
</p><p>Our next step was to reduce our dependence on the constructs that were going to prove difficult 
      to convert: especially generics, and the use of <code class="code">CharSequence</code>. I have described in more detail how we 
      achieved this in blog postings: <a href="#ftn.d5e1341" class="footnote" shape="rect"><sup class="footnote" id="d5e1341">[7]</sup></a>
      <a href="#ftn.d5e1344" class="footnote" shape="rect"><sup class="footnote" id="d5e1344">[8]</sup></a>.
</p><p>Generics are difficult because although Java and C# use superficially-similar syntax (for example 
      <code class="code">List&lt;String&gt;</code>) the semantics are very different. 
  In C# instances are annotated at run-time with the full expanded type, and one can therefore write 
  run-time tests such as x is <code class="code">List&lt;String&gt;</code>. Writing <code class="code">x is List</code> will return false: <code class="code">List&lt;String&gt;</code> 
  is not a subtype of <code class="code">List</code>. By contrast, with Java, the type parameters are used only at compile time 
  and are discarded at run time (the process is called <span class="emphasis"><em>Type Erasure</em></span>). This means that on Java, 
  <code class="code">x instanceof List&lt;String&gt;</code> is not allowed, while <code class="code">x instanceof List</code> returns true.
</p><p>We decided to reduce the scale of the problem by dropping some of our use of generics 
      from the product. In particular, in Saxon 9.9, two key interfaces, <code class="code">Sequence</code> and <code class="code">SequenceIterator</code>, 
      were defined with type parameters restricting the type of items contained in an XDM sequence, 
      and we dropped this in Saxon 10.0. The use of type parameters here had always been somewhat 
      unsatisfactory, for two reasons:
</p><p>Most of the time, the code has to deal with sequences-of-anything: we don't know statically, 
      when we write the Saxon code, what type of input it is going to be dealing with (that depends on 
      the user-written stylesheet). So providing the type parameter (<code class="code">Sequence&lt;Item&gt;</code>) simply doesn't 
      add any value.
</p><p>The XDM model for sequences has the property that an item is a sequence of length one. So 
      <code class="code">Item</code> implements <code class="code">Sequence&lt;Item&gt;</code>. Which means that a subclass of <code class="code">Item</code>, such as <code class="code">DateTimeValue</code>, 
      implements <code class="code">Sequence&lt;DateTimeValue&gt;</code>. Which followed to its logical conclusion mans that a 
      <code class="code">DateTimeValue</code> is an <code class="code">Item&lt;DateTimeValue&gt;</code>, and a generic item is therefore an <code class="code">Item&lt;Item&gt;</code> 
      (or is it an <code class="code">Item&lt;Item&lt;Item&lt;...&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>?). Modelling the XDM structure accurately using 
      Java generics proved very difficult, and in the end, it introduced a whole load of complexity 
      without adding much value. Getting rid of it was welcome.
</p><p>As far as the <code class="code">CharSequence</code> interface is concerned, we used this extensively in interfaces 
      where strings are passed around, to enable us to use implementations of strings other than the 
      Java <code class="code">String</code> class. For example, the whitespace that often occurs between elements in an XML document 
      is compressed using run-length encoding as a <code class="code">CompressedWhitespace</code> object, which implements the 
      <code class="code">CharSequence</code> interface, and can therefore be substituted in many cases for a Java <code class="code">String</code>.
</p><p>The use of <code class="code">CharSequence</code> isn't perfect for this purpose, however. Firstly, it has the same problem 
      as a Java <code class="code">String</code> in that it models a string as a sequence of 16-bit UTF-16 char values, using a 
      surrogate pair to represent Unicode astral codepoints. In XPath, strings need to be codepoint-addressible 
      (at least for the purposes of functions such as <code class="code">substring()</code> and <code class="code">translate()</code>), and neither <code class="code">String</code> nor 
      <code class="code">CharSequence</code> meets this requirement. There are also issues concerning comparison across different 
      implementations of the <code class="code">CharSequence</code> interface, plus the fact that many commonly used methods in the 
      standard Java class library require the <code class="code">CharSequence</code> to be converted to a <code class="code">String</code>, which generally 
      involves copying the content. In addition, the <code class="code">CharSequence</code> interface doesn't guarantee immutability. 
      For these reasons, we had already introduced another string representation, the <code class="code">UnicodeString</code>, which 
      we were using in many corners of the code, notably when processing regular expressions.
</p><p>C# has no direct equivalent of <code class="code">CharSequence</code>: that is, an interface which is implemented by the 
      standard String class, but which also allows for other implementations. The interface <code class="code">IEnumerable&lt;Char&gt;</code> 
      comes close, but that doesn't allow for direct addressing to get the <span class="emphasis"><em>N</em></span>th character in a string.
</p><p>So we decided to scrap our extensive use of <code class="code">CharSequence</code> throughout the product, and replace it with 
      our own <code class="code">UnicodeString</code> interface – which allows for direct codepoint addressing, rather than <code class="code">char</code> 
      addressing with surrogate pairs. There is a performance hit in doing this, because there's a lot 
      of conversion between <code class="code">String</code> and <code class="code">UnicodeString</code> when data crosses the boundary between Saxon and 
      third-party software (notably the XML parser, but also library routines such as <code class="code">upperCase()</code> and 
      <code class="code">lowerCase()</code>). However, it's sufficiently small that most users won't notice the difference, and 
      we can mitigate it – for example we have our own UTF-8 Writer used by the Saxon serializer, and 
      it was easy to extend the UTF-8 Writer to accept a <code class="code">UnicodeString</code> as input, bypassing the conversion 
      of <code class="code">UnicodeString</code> to <code class="code">String</code> prior to UTF-8 encoding.
