It might seem presumptuous to suggest that it could be improved, or indeed that it needs to be improved. However, the original premise of line-based text files as the subject matter is now out of date with more structured information being the norm. Often this is in the form of programming source code where the layout tends to remain fairly consistent through edit cycles, but increasing use of JSON and XML pose particular difficulties for the simple line-based structure of diff3. In our paper at MarkupUK in 2019, we discussed some of the issues and suggested some minor improvements to diff3. These changes suffered from the common complaints of a retro-fit in that they did not sit comfortably with the original and only did half a job. The prevalence of GUIs also suggest that the actual syntax of a diff file is not as important as it was in that the emphasis has changed from human readability to interchange between two applications, for example between a git 'merge driver' and a git 'mergetool'. For these reasons it seemed better to consider a different approach using the tools and formats that are now in common use, for example XML or JSON. What might diff3 look like as an XML format? Would the advantages of a new format make it worth swapping from the tried and tested diff3? Could existing GUI software easily adapt to a new format and, perhaps, even be simpler as a result?" /><link rel="home" href="oxygen-main.html" title="Markup UK 2021 Proceedings" /><link rel="up" href="oxygen-main.html" title="Markup UK 2021 Proceedings" /><link rel="prev" href="ar07s11.html" title="Where do I find my packages?" /><link rel="next" href="ar08s01.html" title="Introduction and Background" /><!--  Generated with Oxygen version 23.1, build number 2021022614.  --><link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="oxygen-webhelp/resources/css/webhelp_topic.css"><!----></link><script type="text/javascript" xml:space="preserve"><!--
