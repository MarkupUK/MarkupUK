            entirely in XSLT 3.0.</p><p>There were two reasons for undertaking this project:</p><div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style=""><li class="listitem"><p>Firstly, we see a demand to make implementations of the latest XML standards
                    from W3C available on a wider variety of platforms. The base standards (XML 1.0,
                    XPath 1.0, XSLT 1.0, XSD 1.0) that came out between 1998 and 2001 were very
                    widely implemented, but subsequent refinements of these standards have seen far
                    less vendor support. One can identify a number of reasons for this: perhaps the
                    first versions of the standards met 90% of the requirements, and the market for
                    subsequent enhancements is therefore much smaller; perhaps the early
                    implementors found that their version 1 products were commercially unsuccessful
                    and they therefore found it difficult to make a business case for further
                    investment. In the case of products like libxml/libxslt produced by enthusiasts
                    working in their spare time, perhaps the enthusiasts are more excited by a brand
                    new technology than by version 2 of something well established. Whatever the
                    causes, XSD 1.1 in particular only has three known implementations (Altova,
                    Saxon, and Xerces) compared with dozens of implementations of XSD 1.0, despite
                    the fact that there is a high level of consensus in the user community that the
                    new features are extremely useful.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Secondly, as editor of the XSLT 3.0 specification and developer of a leading
                    implementation of the language, I felt a need to "get my hands dirty" by
                    developing an application in XSLT 3.0 that would stretch the capabilities of the
                    language. I am often called on to provide advice to XSLT 3.0 users, and even now
                    that the language specification is complete, I find myself designing extensions
                    to meet requirements that go beyond the base standard, and this can only be done
                    on the basis of personal experience in using the language "in anger" for real
                    applications. In addition, the usability of a language compiler depends in high
                    measure on the quality of diagnostics available, and improving the quality of
                    diagnostics depends entirely on a feedback process: you need to make real
                    programming mistakes, spot when the diagnostics could be more helpful, and make
                    the required changes. </p></li></ul></div><p>More specifically, Saxonica has released an implementation of XSLT 3.0 written in
            Javascript to run in the browser, and an obvious next step is to extend that
            implementation to run under Node.js on the server. But for the server environment we
            need to implement a larger subset of the language, and so the question arose, should we
            write a version of the schema processor in Javascript? However, Javascript is not the
            only language of interest: we're also seeing demand for our technology from users whose
            programming environment is C, C++, C#, PHP, or Python. Since (using a variety of tools)
            we've been trying to deliver XSLT 3.0 capability in all these environments, a natural
            next step is to try and deliver a schema processor that will run on any of these
            platforms, by writing it in portable XSLT 3.0 code.</p><p>Architecturally, there are two parts to an XSD schema processor:</p><div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style=""><li class="listitem"><p>The first part is the schema compiler. This takes as input the source XSD
                    schema documents, and performs as much pre-processing of this input as it can
                    prior to the validation of actual XML instances against the schema. This
                    preprocessing includes verification that the schema documents themselves
                    represent a valid schema, and other tasks such as expanding defaults. The XSD
                    specification from W3C describes a "schema component model" which is an abstract
                    description of a data structure that can be used to represent a compiled schema;
                    and it gives detailed rules for translating source schema documents to this
                    abstract data model. The Saxon schema processor follows this approach very
                    closely, and it also defines a concrete XML-based representation of the schema
                    component model which realises the output of the schema compilation phase in
                    concrete form. This output in fact contains a little more than the SCM
                    components and their properties; it also contains a representation of the finite
                    state machines used to implement the grammar of complex types defined in the
                    schema.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The second part is the instance validator. The instance validator takes two
                    inputs: the compiled schema (SCM) output by the schema compiler, and an XML
                    instance document to be validated. In principle its output is a PSVI (post
                    schema validation infoset) containing the instance document as a tree, decorated
                    with information derived from schema validation, including information
                    identifying nodes that are found to be invalid. In practice, in the Saxon
                    implementation, there are two outputs: a validation report, which in its
                    canonical form is an XML document listing all the validation errors that were
                    found, and a tree representation of the instance document with added type
                    annotations, in the form prescribed by the XDM data model used by XPath, XQuery,
                    and XSLT. Because the Saxon schema validator is primarily designed to meet the
                    schema processing requirements of XSLT and XQuery, it only delivers the subset
                    of PSVI required in that environment: this means that the output XML tree is
                    only delivered if it is found to be valid, and the only tree decorations added
                    by the validator are references from valid element and attribute nodes to the
                    schema types against which they were validated. In effect, if the input is
                    valid, then the output of the Saxon schema validator is a representation of the
                    input XML instances with added type annotations; while if the input is invalid,
                    then the output is a report listing validation errors.</p></li></ul></div><p>The software described in this paper is an XSLT 3.0 implementation of the instance
            validator. It would certainly be possible to write an XSLT 3.0 implementation of the
            schema compiler, and we may well do that next, but we haven't tackled this yet. </p><p>Moreover, the only output of the instance validator described here is a validation
            report showing the validation errors. The software doesn't attempt to produce an XDM
            representation of the input document with type annotations. In fact, this isn't possible
            to do using standard XSLT 3.0 without extensions. XSLT 3.0 has no instructions to output
            elements and attributes with specific type annotations; the only way it can generate
            typed output is by putting the output through a schema validator, which is assumed to
            exist as an external component. So to write that part of the validator in XSLT 3.0, we
            would need to invent some language extensions.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><span class="navprev"><a accesskey="p" href="ar12.html" shape="rect">Prev</a></span> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="u" href="ar12.html" shape="rect">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> <span class="navnext"><a accesskey="n" href="ar12s02.html" shape="rect">Next</a></span></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="h" href="oxygen-main.html" shape="rect">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td></tr></table></div><div class="footer">Generated by<a class="oxyFooter" href="http://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_webhelp.html" target="_blank" shape="rect">
