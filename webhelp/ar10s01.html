An XML Pipeline Language" shape="rect">[1]</a> is clearly an XML-centric language to design workflows, actually it is
            mostly an XML-only workflow language. To quote the  XProc 1.0 specification:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Although some steps can read and write non-XML resources, what flows between steps through 
                input ports and output ports are <span class="emphasis"><em>exclusively</em></span> XML documents or sequences of XML documents.
            </p></blockquote></div><p>This XML-only approach proved to be fine for a lot of tasks, but as it turns out, even
            workflows dealing mostly with XML documents also have the need to deal with non-XML
            data. Just think of an ePUB mostly containing XHTML documents, but also having some
            JPEGs with illustrations, a manifest file which is pure text and finally being
            essentially a special kind of ZIP-document. </p><p>As such workflows show up quite often in real day life, the ability to deal with
            non-XML documents was a high priority requirement when developing the next version of
            XProc, which is called "XProc 3.0".<a href="#ftn.d5e4181" class="footnote" shape="rect"><sup class="footnote" id="d5e4181">[16]</sup></a></p><p>In this paper I would like to give an introduction to workflows for non-XML documents
            in XProc 3.0. To do this as practically as possible I decided to layout a typical
            workflow involving the necessity to deal with non-XML documents and to show, how this
            could be done in XProc 3.0. Of course the workflow is a little bit of a made-up
            story because it was chosen for the purpose of demonstration. But it will show some
            basic structures of dealing with non-XML documents in XProc 3.0 and can serve as a
            blueprint for real life projects. </p><p>The workflow discussed here is this: We have a bunch of ePUBs in a folder somewhere
            and we have been asked to design a workflow which analyses the content of the ePUB and
            creates an RDF metadata description and an inventory in JSON which has to be sent to one
            of our inventory-servers which – for whatever reason – happens to understand only JSON.
            I will explain the details of this workflow later, but please keep in mind that it
            involves dealing with a lot of non-XML documents such as ZIP (the ePUB itself), plain
            text, graphics in JPEG, RDF and last but not least JSON.</p><p>This paper is divided into four parts,  the third part being the central one:</p><div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style=""><li class="listitem"><p>We will start with a short reminder on how one could deal with non-XML
                        documents in XProc 1.0. As I said before, XProc 1.0 clearly is an
                        XML-centric language, but there are some possibilities to deal with non-XML
                        documents. To give a short reprise will hopefully help to understand the new
                        features of XProc 3.0.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>In order to cope with non-XML documents, some fundamental changes had to
                        be made in the transition from XProc 1.0 to the new XProc 3.0. The
                        most important point here was to change the concept of a document that flows
                        from one step to another. While in XProc 1.0 a document is a
                        well-formed XML document only, for XProc 3.0 we needed a new document
                        model which is able to cover XML and non-XML documents as well. In the
                        second section of this paper we will take a short look at this new concept
                        of a document as a foundation to understand how non-XML workflows can be
                        created in XProc 3.0.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The core of this paper is the third section where we will discuss in some
                        detail how to design the sketched workflow for ePUBs. Here you will see the
                        new document model in action and get to know some of the new XProc steps,
                        which take advantage of this model and enable you to write workflows for
                        non-XML documents.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>In the last section you will find a short summary and some conclusion
                        concerning the suitability of XProc 3.0 for non-XML workflows.</p></li></ul></div><p>
        </p><p>A short caveat before we start: By the time of writing this article (May 2018),
            XProc 3.0 is still work in progress. While the document model can surely be seen as
            stable, the steps mentioned later are probably not. Though their basic outline is very
            unlikely to change, details may change as the discussion goes along. Especially the
            signature of the newly introduced steps and the dynamic errors raised by these steps
            might be subject to change in the process of standardising XProc 3.0. As a result
            of this situation, this paper is clearly not suitable as a tutorial on XProc 3.0,
            but is intended as a first look at the new possibilities in this language. Before you
