            requirement for a dominant hierarch as such. A given overlap situation can be
            represented in a number of different ways, all of which are valid in that they correctly
            represent the overlap. As mentioned earlier, a representation is deemed to be correct if
            it is possible to generate each of the original hierarchies without loss from the
            overlap representation, and this implies there may be more than one correct
            representation. There may be different ways to define what might be an 'optimal'
            representation, but it seems that minimising the splitting of elements is a key aspect
            of this.</p><p>Some form of milestone representation may be a starting point because this is one of
            the most intuitive ways to represent overlap. How then do we process a milestone
            representation to get to an optimal solution using the delta format described here? The
            problem is to work out where there is overlap and which element or elements need to be
            split to remove this overlap. This is fairly easy for simple overlaps of two elements
            but it is not simple in the situation where there are multiple, arbitary overlaps.
            Minimising splits can result in having different XML hierarchies, e.g. a particular
            element type in document A may be both surrounding and within the same element type from
            document B. Both the A and B document can be generated from this but it can look odd in
            the delta file and a processor cannot rely on the same nesting in all situations. It is
            also true that although elements such as &lt;b&gt; or &lt;i&gt; could be nested either one
            inside the other (the nesting is commutative), this may not be the case with all element
            combinations.</p><p>In practice, different representations are useful for different purposes. In some
            cases it is preferable to avoid overlap by duplication of content but then the issue is
            to find the minimum duplication to achieve this. It may be easy in some situations to
            process milestones but again it is preferable that milestones are only used when they
            need to be and by finding the minimul split representation it is simple then to achieve
            minimum milestones from this.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><span class="navprev"><a accesskey="p" href="ar13s05.html" shape="rect">Prev</a></span> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="u" href="ar13.html" shape="rect">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> <span class="navnext"><a accesskey="n" href="ar13s07.html" shape="rect">Next</a></span></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="h" href="oxygen-main.html" shape="rect">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td></tr></table></div><div class="footer">Generated by<a class="oxyFooter" href="http://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_webhelp.html" target="_blank" shape="rect">
