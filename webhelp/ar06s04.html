      mentioned in the previous section, merging the list of seen attributes was
      very slow. <span class="emphasis"><em>Not</em></span> merging them saved a lot of time but
      produced wrong answers.</p><p>This is when the author started to suspect that the entire input was
      being kept in memory. The Saxon <span class="emphasis"><em>uri-collection()</em></span>
      function was being called with a <span class="emphasis"><em>stable=no</em></span> parameter,
      which the documentation seemed to suggest would mean the documents would
      not need to be kept in memory.</p><p>It appears, based on testing, that in fact
        <span class="emphasis"><em>stable=no</em></span> simply means that calling
        <span class="emphasis"><em>uri-collection()</em></span> multiple times in the same run
      might not always return the same set of document URIs (filenames). It does
        <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> mean that the documents themselves are not
      guaranteed to be stable, and hence does <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> mean the
      documents are not kept in memory.</p><p>In the end what worked was processing each input document in an
      external stylesheet, called using the XPath 3
        <span class="emphasis"><em>fn:transform()</em></span> function. Since each invocation of
      XSLT was separate, it seemed memory was not retained between them, and
      FreqX ran much faster.</p><pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">xsl:sequence select="transform(
  map {
    'stylesheet-location' : $process-file-xsl,
    'initial-template' : QName((), 'initial-template'),
    'stylesheet-params' : map {
        QName('http://www.delightfulcomputing.com/', 'freqx-control-doc') : $freqx-control-doc,
        QName('http://www.delightfulcomputing.com/', 'freqx-input-uri') : $this?name
    }
  }
)?output/*" /&gt;</pre><p>Performance can to some extent be measured using the builtin profiling
      in Saxon; an alternative is to transform the XSLT style sheet to add
        <code class="code">xsl:message</code> instructions at the start and end of each
      template of interest, and then to analyze timestamps on the log
      file.</p><p>Since XPath functions are deterministic, functions such as
        <span class="emphasis"><em>fn:current-time()</em></span> always return the same value
      within a single XSLT episode. Therefore the time for profiling must be
      reported either with a Java native method call, or by using an external
      tool such as the combination of <span class="emphasis"><em>ts</em></span> and
        <span class="emphasis"><em>unbuffer</em></span> from the Linux more-utils package. The
        <span class="emphasis"><em>ts</em></span> command adds timestamps to each line of input.
      However, program standard output is buffered for efficiency and is
      delivered in clumps when the buffer is full. The
        <span class="emphasis"><em>unbuffer</em></span> command can be used to prevent that
      buffering and get accurate timestamps.</p><p>Timings can also be obtained by separate runs of the external
      stylesheet that would be called using <span class="emphasis"><em>fn:transform()</em></span>,
      and memory can be measured, for example on Linux or Unix systems with
        <span class="emphasis"><em>/usr/bin/time</em></span> (<span class="emphasis"><em>time</em></span> without
      the path is a built-in in many shells, including
      <span class="emphasis"><em>bash</em></span>, that gives less information).</p><p>People running timings need to keep overall system activity in mind,
      as well as overall system memory usage.</p><p>In the case of FreqX, memory rose to over sixty gigabytes on a test
      collection, and it became clear it was keeping all of the documents in
      memory.</p><p>Changing FreqX to use fn:transform() on the result of doc($filename)
      did not help.</p><p>Passing $filename as a parameter to the external stylesheet
        <span class="emphasis"><em>did</em></span> help: runtime was reduced dramatically, as was
      memory usage.</p><p>A further refinement was to keep namespace URIs as integer keys into a
      map instead of strings, but the additional complexity of passing that back
      from the external stylesheet did not seem justified; the author may return
      to this in the future.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><span class="navprev"><a accesskey="p" href="customizations.html" shape="rect">Prev</a></span> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="u" href="ar06.html" shape="rect">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> <span class="navnext"><a accesskey="n" href="ar06s05.html" shape="rect">Next</a></span></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="h" href="oxygen-main.html" shape="rect">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td></tr></table></div><div class="footer">Generated by<a class="oxyFooter" href="http://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_webhelp.html" target="_blank" shape="rect">
