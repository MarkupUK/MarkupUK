      <a href="#ftn.d5e1301" class="footnote" shape="rect"><sup class="footnote" id="d5e1301">[3]</sup></a>, 
      a Java implementation of the W3C XSLT, 
      XQuery, XPath, and XSD specifications. The product has also been made available on the 
      .NET platform, by converting the bytecode generated by the Java compiler into the equivalent 
      intermediate language (called IL) on .NET. The tool for this conversion was the open-source 
      IKVMC library<a href="#ftn.d5e1304" class="footnote" shape="rect"><sup class="footnote" id="d5e1304">[4]</sup></a> developed by Jeroen Frijters.
    </p><p>IKVMC was largely a one-man project, and when Jeroen (after many years of faithful 
      service to the community) decided to move on to other things, there was no-one to step 
      into his capable shoes, and the project has languished.
    </p><p>In 2019, Microsoft announced a change of direction for the .NET 
      platform<a href="#ftn.d5e1309" class="footnote" shape="rect"><sup class="footnote" id="d5e1309">[5]</sup></a>. .NET had 
      diverged into two separate strands of development, known as .NET Framework and .NET Core, 
      and Microsoft announced in effect that .NET Framework would be discontinued, and the 
      future lay with .NET Core. The differences between the two strands need not really concern 
      us here, except to note that IKVMC never supported .NET Core, therefore Saxon didn't run on 
      .NET Core, and therefore we needed to find a different way forward.
    </p><p>The way that we chose was source code conversion from Java to C#. At the time of writing 
      this has been successfully achieved for a large subset of the Saxon product, and work is 
      ongoing to convert the remainder. This paper describes how it was done.
    </p><p>Let's start by describing the objectives of the project:
</p><div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style=""><li class="listitem"><p>Automated conversion of as much of the source code as possible from Java to C#.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Repeatable conversion: this is not a one-off conversion to create a fork of the code; 
          we want to continue developing and maintaining the master Java code and port all changes 
          over to C# using the same conversion technology.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Performance: the performance of the final product on .NET must be at least as good 
          as the existing product. In fact, we would like it to be considerably better, because 
          (for reasons we have never fully understood) some workloads on the current product 
          perform much more slowly than on the Java platform.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Maintainability: although we don't intend to develop the C# code independently, 
          we will certainly need to debug it, and that means we need to generate human-readable code.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Adaptability: because the .NET platform is different from the Java platform, 
          some parts of the product need to behave differently. We need to have convenient 
          mechanisms to manage these differences.
</p></li></ul></div><p>I should also stress one non-objective: we were not setting out to provide a tool that 
      could convert any Java program to C# fully automatically. We only needed to convert one (admittedly 
      rather large) program, and this meant that:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>We only needed to convert Java constructs that Saxon actually uses (which turns out to be quite 
          a small subset of the total Java platform).
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>In the case of constructs that Saxon uses rarely, we could do some manual assistance of 
          the conversion, rather than requiring it fully automatic. Indeed, by Zipf's law, many of the 
          Java constructs that Saxon uses are only used once in the entire product, and in many cases 
          they are used unnecessarily and could easily be rewritten a different way (sometimes beneficially). 
          The main device we have used for this manual assistance is the use of Java annotations in the 
          source code, annotations that are specially recognised as hints by the converter.
