  support for processing and generating JSON alongside XML. The new features have proved
  useful, but they have known limitations.</p><p>Saxonica, for example, uses the JSON capabilities in XSLT 3.0 when processing
  new online orders from customers for the Saxon product. We use a third-party service,
  Ecwid, that supplies details of new orders in JSON format, and we use an XSLT application
  to process this order, add the details to our XML orders database, and generate license
  keys and email notifications to the customer. The application uses XForms and SaxonJS. It
  pulls the JSON information from Ecwid using a call on <code class="code">fn:json-doc</code> with
    an appropriate URI, and then extracts the required data using path expressions such as</p><pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">&lt;xsl:variable 
      name="subscriptionOption" 
      select="$items?items?1?recurringChargeSettings" 
      as="map(*)?" /&gt;   
    </pre><p>The JSON structure is straightforward,
  and the features in XSLT 3.0 and XPath 3.1 are more than adequate to handle it.
    <a href="#ftn.d5e1217" class="footnote" shape="rect"><sup class="footnote" id="d5e1217">[3]</sup></a></p><p>But the capabilities of XSLT for processing JSON are more limited than the
    capabilities for processing XML. One of these limitations, the one addressed in this
    paper, is the ability to transform JSON using XSLT's quintessential processing model:
    rule-based recursive-descent transformation using template rules.
    </p><p>A project is currently underway, informally known as QT4, to define 4.0 versions
    of the XSLT, XPath, and XQuery languages. This project has been set up as a W3C Community Group
    and meets weekly to discuss and agree proposed changes to the specification. The activity
    can be tracked online at <code class="uri">https://qt4cg.org/</code> and of course anyone is welcome
    to participate. To date over 500 changes to the specifications have been accepted, and
    most of these have been implemented in Saxon and/or BaseX; more than 12,000 test cases
    have been added to the XQuery test suite alone, on top of the 32,000 test cases already
    available for the 3.1 specifications<a href="#ftn.d5e1223" class="footnote" shape="rect"><sup class="footnote" id="d5e1223">[4]</sup></a>.</p><p>But I was concerned that we hadn't really tackled or solved the issues concerned
    with recursive-descent transformation. Back in 2016, before XSLT 3.0 was even finalised,
    I published a paper [<a class="citation" href="references.html#d5e1556" shape="rect"><span class="citation">Kay 2016</span></a>] at XML Prague in 2016 
    giving a couple of worked examples of JSON transformations using XSLT 3.0, coming to the rather
    unhappy conclusion that they were best tackled by converting the JSON to XML, transforming
    the XML, and then converting the XML back to JSON. I returned to these examples in a Balisage
    paper in 2022 [<a class="citation" href="references.html#d5e1566" shape="rect"><span class="citation">Kay 2022</span></a>]
    where I showed that these two particular problems could be tackled much more easily using
    new features proposed for XSLT 4.0; however I remained uneasy that neither of the two problems
    really featured the recursive-descent processing paradigm.</p><p>So I resolved to conduct a case-study in which I would select a realistic application
    in which recursive-descent rule-based transformation of JSON input was a requirement, and
    use this application to test the usability of the XSLT 4.0 specifications in their current
    state, and propose enhancements where they were found to be necessary. This paper summarises
    the conclusions of that study. A blow-by-blow account containing contemporaneous notes of
    the tasks undertaken can be found at <code class="uri">https://github.com/qt4cg/qtspecs/issues/1786</code>;
    this paper focuses more on the final conclusions, and ignores some of the avenues I followed
    that produced no useful insights.</p><div class="footnotes"><br clear="none" /><hr style="width:100; text-align:left;margin-left: 0" /><div id="ftn.d5e1217" class="footnote"><p><a href="#d5e1217" class="para" shape="rect"><sup class="para">[3] </sup></a>More details of this application can be found at

      At the time of that paper the Ecwid data feed was plain text rather than JSON, but the paper does describe
    some other ways in which the application uses JSON internally.</p></div><div id="ftn.d5e1223" class="footnote"><p><a href="#d5e1223" class="para" shape="rect"><sup class="para">[4] </sup></a>Data obtained, naturally, using Saxon and XQuery.</p></div></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><span class="navprev"><a accesskey="p" href="ar04.html" shape="rect">Prev</a></span> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="u" href="ar04.html" shape="rect">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> <span class="navnext"><a accesskey="n" href="ar04s02.html" shape="rect">Next</a></span></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="h" href="oxygen-main.html" shape="rect">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td></tr></table></div><div class="footer">Generated by<a class="oxyFooter" href="http://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_webhelp.html" target="_blank" shape="rect">
