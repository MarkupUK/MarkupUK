It can also be a a journey filled with dead ends, trap doors, and slowly-revealed and difficult to identify problems. Like many public tag sets, JATS (the Journal Article Tag Suite) was designed to be customized. Our original expectation was that individual users would customize it, and while a few have done that to good effect, we have found that the major customizations have been by groups of users. BITS (the Book Interchange Tag Suite), NISO STS (Standards Tag Suite), and Manuscript Exchange Common Approach (MECA) are widely adopted customizations of JATS. When users customize a tag set they expect to be able to use the existing infrastructure associated with that tag set, making changes to accommodate the changes they made. They often expect to intermingle their new documents with documents tagged to the original tag set and perhaps with documents tagged to other customizations of the source tag set. They expect this to work gracefully, easily, seamlessly. Sometimes it does, but sometimes it does not! The JATS Compatibility Meta-Model Description was developed to help people who customize JATS create tag sets to create models that will coexist peacefully with existing JATS documents and with documents tagged to other JATS customizations. It seems unlikely that the particulars of the JATS Compatibility Model will apply to other tag sets, but the principles behind the Meta-Model might be useful to other groups thinking about ways to make their families of tag sets flexible and compatible...";

There is an International Standard that meets political needs and a site with non-normative documentation that meets practical needs. There are third party sites advising users on how to use the tag sets for best interoperability, and many organizations that ingest JATS provide (and may insist on) site-specific local rules. It is entirely possible that JATS is the most heavily documented XML tag set of all time. Do other tag sets need this much documentation? Are there techniques other tag sets would find useful? After a guided tour of the JATS documentation, the audience can chime in: How much documentation does a tag set need? Do any tag sets need this much documentation? How much documentation does YOUR tag set need? What is useful? IS any of this overkill? What audience most needs to be served? What parts of the Tag Library you like? What parts not so much?

It might seem presumptuous to suggest that it could be improved, or indeed that it needs to be improved. However, the original premise of line-based text files as the subject matter is now out of date with more structured information being the norm. Often this is in the form of programming source code where the layout tends to remain fairly consistent through edit cycles, but increasing use of JSON and XML pose particular difficulties for the simple line-based structure of diff3. In our paper at MarkupUK in 2019, we discussed some of the issues and suggested some minor improvements to diff3. These changes suffered from the common complaints of a retro-fit in that they did not sit comfortably with the original and only did half a job. The prevalence of GUIs also suggest that the actual syntax of a diff file is not as important as it was in that the emphasis has changed from human readability to interchange between two applications, for example between a git &apos;merge driver&apos; and a git &apos;mergetool&apos;. For these reasons it seemed better to consider a different approach using the tools and formats that are now in common use, for example XML or JSON. What might diff3 look like as an XML format? Would the advantages of a new format make it worth swapping from the tried and tested diff3? Could existing GUI software easily adapt to a new format and, perhaps, even be simpler as a result?...";
