                S1000D, and it all looks great, that your job is done! Think again. You have created
                an S1000D XML-based system for people who are almost certainly not XML experts,
                never mind S1000D experts. While they may be experts in the inner workings of an
                aircraft undercarriage you should not expect them to feel right at home with S1000D.
                Probably they had achieved a level of comfort with Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat
                but now you are asking them to start again with XML authoring. Let’s be clear, there
                are big advantages to having structured S1000D over unstructured documents but the
                advantages come at a price. You will need to have rigorous procedures around
                managing, authoring and publishing content. S1000D is not lightweight because the
                aviation industry and the military need robust information management tools to be
                able to ensure flight and equipment safety. You may need to rethink your own
                business process, perhaps by upskilling a core team of technical authors to manage
                this content.</p><p>You will also need to provide quality training materials for your users, which
                they can refer to whenever they need. One of the big advantages of S1000D in this
                regard is that it is a document management system so you can use it can document
                itself! This means that not only can users access training and materials easily but
                they can see, through real examples in the system, how to do the things they need to
                do.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><span class="navprev"><a accesskey="p" href="ar02s06s01.html" shape="rect">Prev</a></span> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="u" href="ar02s06.html" shape="rect">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> <span class="navnext"><a accesskey="n" href="ar02s07.html" shape="rect">Next</a></span></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="h" href="oxygen-main.html" shape="rect">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td></tr></table></div><div class="footer">Generated by<a class="oxyFooter" href="http://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_webhelp.html" target="_blank" shape="rect">
