fixed at this stage. As more clues from more sources are added to the
corpus, it may be that changes are needed in order to accommodate the
quirks of a particular author. There are also some issues for which I
am not sure that satisfactory solutions have yet been found. Perhaps
the largest of these issues is that of reference. Some clues may refer
to other clues within the same puzzle, using the answer to another
clue to construct their own definitions or subsidiary indications. It
is clear that there needs to be a way to indicate such cross-reference
within a puzzle. But what about exophoric reference (reference to
things outside the text)? If we want to understand how linguistic
differences affect the difficulty level of various puzzles, for
example, we might take a discourse-analytic perspective and consider
how the clues reference culture outside the bounds of the puzzle
itself. For example, the "LONDON" clues discussed above refer to two
cultural figures: Don DeLillo and Julie London. These are evidently
figures from different domains - literature and popular music,
respectively. Is this information useful? If so, how can it be
captured? Depth of information is also a question: is it enough to
specify the domain from which these figures come, or would it also be
useful to know the period in which they were active? Should their
status as real-life figures (as opposed to fictional characters) also
be captured?</p><p>The answer to these questions, and to others that will
undoubtedly arise, will need a certain amount of trial and error, and
answers will emerge during the process of marking up more and more
clues. Evidently, the initial stages outlined here are just the
beginning of what promises to be a complex but rewarding
project.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><span class="navprev"><a accesskey="p" href="ar04s03.html" shape="rect">Prev</a></span> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="u" href="ar04.html" shape="rect">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> <span class="navnext"><a accesskey="n" href="bi04.html" shape="rect">Next</a></span></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="h" href="oxygen-main.html" shape="rect">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td></tr></table></div><div class="footer">Generated by<a class="oxyFooter" href="http://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_webhelp.html" target="_blank" shape="rect">
