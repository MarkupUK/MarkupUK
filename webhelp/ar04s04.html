    documents representing the parse tree of a module, and, with the aid of information in the digest
    file, to generate corresponding C# code. This combines two tasks: handling any differences between
    Java and C#, and then serializing the result (with sufficient indentation and spacing to make it
    legible, since we're going to need to debug it).</p><p>For the sake of the case study, I decided to skip the business logic of Java to C# conversion,
    and simply re-serialize the parse tree as Java code. This mirrored the development approach I had used
    for the transpiler, where I first wrote template rules to convert the parse tree back to Java, and then
    incrementally modified the XSLT to handle cases where the C# needed to be different.</p><p>I didn't attempt to rewrite all the template rules, but converted a sufficient subset that several
    of the larger Java modules could be successfully processed. I felt this would give us all the feedback
    we needed on whether the task was feasible.</p><p>A typical (but very simple) template rule in the transpiler might look like this:</p><pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
&lt;xsl:template match="*[@nodeType='ReturnStmt']"&gt;
    &lt;xsl:call-template name="indent"/&gt;
    &lt;xsl:text&gt;return &lt;/xsl:text&gt;
    &lt;xsl:apply-templates select="*"/&gt;
    &lt;xsl:text&gt;;{$NL}&lt;/xsl:text&gt;
&lt;/xsl:template&gt;      
      </pre><p>This rule processes an expression with <code class="code">@nodeType='ReturnStmt'</code> and outputs the
    (Java or C#) text <code class="code">"return XXX;"</code> with suitable indentation, and followed by a newline.
    The <code class="code">XXX</code> here is constructed by recursive application of template rules to the single
    operand of the return statement (if any): <code class="code">select="*"</code> selects the operand, whatever
    it might be, and processes it using its own template rule.</p><p>The rule doesn't need much changing to handle JSON instead of XML. It becomes:</p><pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
&lt;xsl:template match=".[?_nodeType='ReturnStmt']"&gt;
    &lt;xsl:call-template name="indent"/&gt;
    &lt;xsl:text&gt;return &lt;/xsl:text&gt;
    &lt;xsl:apply-templates select="?expression"/&gt;
    &lt;xsl:text&gt;;{$NL}&lt;/xsl:text&gt;
&lt;/xsl:template&gt;   
      </pre><p>Some observations:</p><div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style=""><li class="listitem"><p><code class="code">match="."</code> matches anything. We could have written 
        <code class="code">match="map(*)"</code> to indicate that we're only interested in matching
        maps; or we could have written <code class="code">match="record(_nodeType, *)</code> to indicate
        that we're only interested in matching maps having a <code class="code">"_nodeType</code> property.
        I quite like the idea of combining that with the predicate to allow syntax
        like <code class="code">match="record(_nodeType='ReturnStmt', *)"</code> but that's wishful thinking
        for now.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The <code class="code">xsl:text</code> instruction produces a text node. The stylesheet as a whole
          is producing a text file (Java or C# source code), and the traditional way of doing that
          is to use the XSLT text output method, with a result tree consisting entirely of text nodes.
          There's a lot of inbuilt XML legacy there, but it works.
        </p><p>The variable <code class="code">{$NL}</code> is used in preference to a literal newline because
        it doesn't disrupt the indentation of the code. This is purely a matter of personal style.</p><p>Using the latest features in the XSLT 4.0 spec, we could replace the last three lines
        in the template body with <code class="code">&lt;xsl:text&gt;return {apply-templates(?expression)};{$NL}&lt;/xsl:text&gt;</code>,
        which some people might prefer.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The original XSLT uses <code class="code">select="*"</code> in the <code class="code">apply-templates</code>
        instruction to select all children; the revised XSLT uses <code class="code">select="?expression"</code>
        to select only the <code class="code">expression</code> child. That is because the attributes and children
        of the element node in the XML have all become named properties in the JSON, and <code class="code">?*</code>
        would select them all. There's no convenient way with a lookup expression of saying something
        like <code class="code">select="?* except ?_nodeType"</code> (the XPath <code class="code">except</code> operator
        only works with nodes). We have an open issue on this.</p></li></ul></div><p>It turns out to be rather convenient that we can define the match patterns of template
        rules based on the properties of a map in the JSON, rather than on the associated key. If
    instead of <code class="code">"right":{"_nodeType":"NullLiteralExpr"}</code> we had to cope with
    <code class="code">"NullLiteralExpr":{"_role":"right"}</code> (a design that could equally well have
    been chosen), then the matching would become rather more complex, as we shall see.</p><p>While most of the template rules in this stylesheet match on the value of the
    <code class="code">nodeType</code> attribute, this isn't true of all of them.</p><div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style=""><li class="listitem"><p>With the JSON tree, there's no obvious equivalent of <code class="code">match="/"</code>,
        which matches the root of the tree. There's a good reason for this: the XDM model
        for JSON doesn't include parent pointers, so a map or array that's at the top of
        the tree produced by parsing JSON doesn't actually <span class="emphasis"><em>know</em></span>
        that it's at the top of the tree.</p><p>With this example, we know that the JSON is in the form of a singleton map
        with the key <code class="code">root</code>: that is, the JSON starts with:</p><pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
    { "root":{
        "_nodeType": "CompilationUnit",
        "packageDeclaration": {          
        </pre><p>and we can take advantage of this by using <code class="code">match="record(root)"</code>
        to match the outermost map.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>In other cases where the original stylesheet matched on element name, it was
        usually possible to exploit redundancy in the data to match on properties instead.
        For example the element with name <code class="code">packageDeclaration</code> always
        has the attribute <code class="code">nodeType="packageDeclaration"</code>, and the element
        with name <code class="code">imports</code> contains a sequence of elements each having the
        attribute <code class="code">nodeType="importDeclaration"</code>.</p><p>In one or two cases a template rule that matched on an element name
        (to handle a particular part of an expression, such a the <code class="code">finally</code>
        clause of a try/catch) could simply be inlined into the calling template.</p></li></ul></div><p>The conclusion from this exercise was that the conversion to handle JSON rather than
    XML input was straightforward — but that we had been lucky. The template rules all matched
    on attribute values rather than element names; and none of them made use of features such as
    XML node identity, or access to parents, ancestors, or siblings, that would be difficult
    to replicate in the JSON world.</p><p>Also: I've glossed over the fact that in this phase, I was merely looking at the code
    that serializes the parse tree back to Java, and skipped the “business logic” that does the
    conversion from Java to C#. That code, from a fairly superficial examination, includes
    a few things that are rather harder to deal with:</p><div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style=""><li class="listitem"><p>The template rules access information from the digest file using an <code class="code">xsl:key</code>
        definition. The key definition is essentially the same as that described in the subsequent
        section <span class="emphasis"><em>Refining the digest file</em></span>, and creates the same challenges.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>There are a number of functions and templates that use the parent or attribute axis
        to examine the context of an expression. For example there is a function <code class="code">isInterfaceMember</code>
        that distinguishes methods defined in a class from methods defined in an interface, which it
        does by searching the ancestor axis to see whether the containing type is a class or an interface.
        With a JSON model there are always two ways of tackling this: the needed context information
        (class or interface?) can be passed down the call tree as a tunnel parameter, or the mechanism
        for pinning the tree can be used to expose an equivalent to the ancestor axis. This is discussed
        further in a later section.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><span class="navprev"><a accesskey="p" href="ar04s03.html" shape="rect">Prev</a></span> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="u" href="ar04.html" shape="rect">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> <span class="navnext"><a accesskey="n" href="ar04s05.html" shape="rect">Next</a></span></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="h" href="oxygen-main.html" shape="rect">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td></tr></table></div><div class="footer">Generated by<a class="oxyFooter" href="http://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_webhelp.html" target="_blank" shape="rect">
