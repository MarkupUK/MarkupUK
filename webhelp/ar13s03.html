            tag and its content so that we can make assertions about the tag and content separately
            and independently.</p><p>As a starting point, we can add an attribute to an element to indicate whether or not
            this element was present in a particular variant of the document. If the element was
            present, then the implication is that both the tag and the contents were present. In the
            above situation, we want to indicate that the content, i.e. the word 'quick', was
            present in two versions, but the tag, i.e. the &lt;s&gt;, was only present in one version.
            We can take a simple approach to this and add an additional attribute with this
            information.</p><pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">&lt;p dx=”A,B” dxTag=”A,B”&gt;The 
  &lt;s dx=”A,B” dxTag=”B”&gt;quick&lt;/s&gt; 
  brown fox.&lt;/p&gt;</pre><p>Here, the dx attributes tells us the documents in which the element (and its content)
            were present, as described above. But now the dxTag attribute tells us a bit more:
            whether or not the tag itself was present. So where the document identifiers are the
            same in both the dx attribute and the dxTag attribute, the element and its content were
            present. Where we see dx='A,B' and dxTag='B' we can deduce that the tag was present only
            in B. This means that A contained ‘quick’ and B contained ‘&lt;s&gt;quick&lt;/s&gt;’.</p><p>We can optimize this a little by omiting the dxTag attribute if its value is the same
            as the dx value. Therefore we
            get:</p><pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">&lt;p dx=”A,B”&gt;The 
  &lt;s dx=”A,B” dxTag=”B”&gt;quick&lt;/s&gt;
  brown fox.&lt;/p&gt;</pre><p>This is a simple representation of a simple change. We can make an adjustment to this
            to represent, for example, a change from &lt;i&gt; in document A to &lt;s&gt; in document B as
            follows:</p><pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">&lt;p dx=”A,B”&gt;The 
  &lt;i dx=”A,B” dxTag=”A”&gt;&lt;s dx=”A,B” dxTag=”B”&gt;quick&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
  brown fox.&lt;/p&gt;</pre><p>We can now introduce some overlap and see how the principles above are extended. When
            overlap occurs, in order to avoid duplicating content, we need to split some of the
            elements into fragments - this is the approach that Jeni Tennison calls 'fragmentation'.
            When we fragment an element, then clearly one original element becomes two or more
            fragments. The dxTag attribute refers to the whole tag, so we need to extend this to
            represent the start and the end. To achieve this we have dxTagStart and dxTagEnd so that
            we clearly distinguish between the start fragment and the end fragment. In more complex
            situations where an element is split into more than two fragments, we also introduce
            dxTagMiddle for any fragement betwen the start and end fragments.</p><p>This is an example of simple
            overlap:</p><pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">&lt;p&gt;The quick brown fox. It jumped over the lazy dog.&lt;/p&gt;</pre><pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">&lt;p&gt;The quick brown fox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It jumped over the lazy dog.&lt;/p&gt;</pre><p>This is represented
            as:</p><pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">&lt;p dxTagStart="A" dxTag="B" dx="A,B"&gt;The quick brown fox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dxTagEnd="A" dxTag="B" dx="A,B"&gt; It jumped over the lazy dog.&lt;/p&gt;</pre><p>This shows two &lt;p&gt; elements, and for the B document each of these represents a
            complete element, denoted by dxTag="B". For the A document, the two &lt;p&gt; elements are
            fragements and so the first is identified by dxTagStart="A" and the second one by
            dxTagEnd="A". This is an unambiguous representation that requires no duplication of
            textual content. The astute observer may comment that the leading space in the second
            paragraph of the B document would probably have been deleted. Proper handling of
            whitespace is a consumer of considerable time and effort in XML document processing.
            This type of change could be represented but it complicates the story so is ignored for
            this example.</p><p>We can now consider an example of double overlap, where text is moved from one
            paragraph to
            another:</p><pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">&lt;p&gt;The quick brown fox. It jumped over the lazy dog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes!&lt;/p&gt;</pre><pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">&lt;p&gt;The quick brown fox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It jumped over the lazy dog. Yes!&lt;/p&gt;</pre><p>This is represented
            as:</p><pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">&lt;p dxTagStart="A" dxTag="B" dx="A,B"&gt;The quick brown fox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dxTagEnd="A" dxTagStart="B" dx="A,B"&gt; It jumped over the lazy dog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dxTag="A" dxTagEnd="B" dx="A,B"&gt; Yes!&lt;/p&gt;</pre><p>This shows three &lt;p&gt; elements, all of which are fragments in at least one document.
            In the B document the first of these represents a complete element, denoted by
            dxTag="B". The last two &lt;p&gt; elements are fragments and so the first is identified by
            dxTagStart="B" and the second one by dxTagEnd="B". This mechanism will scale to any
            level of complexity, for example three or more overlapping hierarchies. As overlap
            increases, so does the fragmentation and therefore the complexity of the result.</p><p>Although there is not time to explore this more fully in this paper, it would
            certainly be interesting to determine how easy it is to perform queries on this
            structure such as, "find all the paragraphs containing both the word 'fox' and the word
            'dog'" and have this return just the A document because in the B document these words
            are in different paragraphs.</p><p>We can now look at a larger example including a change. We will for the example ignore
            white space changes. The A document
            is:</p><pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">&lt;book&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;seg&gt;Scorn not the sonnet;&lt;/seg&gt;
        &lt;seg&gt;critic, you have frowned, Mindless of its just honours;&lt;/seg&gt;
        &lt;seg&gt;with this key SHAKESPEARE unlocked his heart;&lt;/seg&gt;
        &lt;seg&gt;the melody Of this small lute gave ease to Petrarch's wound.&lt;/seg&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/book&gt;</pre><p>And the second, B, document is as
            follows:</p><pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">&lt;book&gt;
    &lt;l&gt;Scorn not the sonnet; critic, you have frowned,&lt;/l&gt;
    &lt;l&gt;Mindless of its just honours; with this key&lt;/l&gt;
    &lt;l&gt;Shakespeare unlocked his heart; the melody&lt;/l&gt;
    &lt;l&gt;Of this small lute gave ease to Petrarch's wound.&lt;/l&gt;
&lt;/book&gt;</pre><p>There are different representations that we can generate for this depending on how we
            decide to nest the fragments. For example, if we generally nest the &lt;seg&gt; elements
            inside the &lt;l&gt; elements, we get this
            result:</p><pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">&lt;book dx="A,B"&gt;
    &lt;p dx="A,B" dxTag="A"&gt;
        &lt;l dx="A,B" dxTag="B"&gt;
            &lt;seg dx="A,B" dxTag="A"&gt;Scorn not the sonnet; &lt;/seg&gt;
            &lt;seg dx="A,B" dxTagStart="A"&gt;critic, you have frowned,&lt;/seg&gt;
        &lt;/l&gt;
        &lt;l dx="A,B" dxTag="B"&gt;
            &lt;seg dx="A,B" dxTagEnd="A"&gt;Mindless of its just honours; &lt;/seg&gt;
            &lt;seg dx="A,B" dxTagStart="A"&gt;with this key&lt;/seg&gt;
        &lt;/l&gt;
        &lt;l dx="A,B" dxTag="B"&gt;
            &lt;seg dx="A,B" dxTagEnd="A"&gt;
                &lt;deltaxml:textGroup dx="A,B"&gt;
                    &lt;deltaxml:text dx="A"&gt;SHAKESPEARE&lt;/deltaxml:text&gt;
                    &lt;deltaxml:text dx="B"&gt;Shakespeare&lt;/deltaxml:text&gt;
                &lt;/deltaxml:textGroup&gt; unlocked his heart;&lt;/seg&gt;
            &lt;seg dx="A,B" dxTagStart="A"&gt;the melody&lt;/seg&gt;
        &lt;/l&gt;
        &lt;l dx="A,B" dxTag="B"&gt;
            &lt;seg dx="A,B" dxTagEnd="A"&gt;Of this small lute gave ease to Petrarch's
                wound.&lt;/seg&gt;
        &lt;/l&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/book&gt; </pre><p>It is instructive to visualize this structure as shown below. Here we are looking at
            it primarily as document A, so the tags and text that belong only to B have been greyed
            out. This is to visualize more clearly the A structure. Some of the &lt;seg&gt; elements
            are still split so these would need to be merged in order to get back to the original A
            document, although the basic original structure of A is apparent.<span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="papers/markupuk-laf01/markupuk-laf01/lafo061201.jpg" width="540" /></span></p><p>This visualization illustrates the very simple nature of this approach. The attributes
            we are adding provide information about an element, specifically for each variant the
            attributes tell us which of the following is true: </p><div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style=""><li class="listitem"><p>The tag and its content are present in this variant and the element is not
                        fragmented</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The tag and its content are present in this variant and the element is
                        fragmented, so this is the start, the end or a middle fragment</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The content is present in this variant but not the tag</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The tag and its content are not present in this variant</p></li></ul></div><p>Therefore it is very simple to extract any one variant from the whole document or any
            part of it. It is also very simple to work out, for a given piece of content, the list
            of ancestors in any variant. An important characteristic of this representation is that
            as the overlap reduces to zero so the representation reduces to the original
            structure.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><span class="navprev"><a accesskey="p" href="ar13s02.html" shape="rect">Prev</a></span> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="u" href="ar13.html" shape="rect">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> <span class="navnext"><a accesskey="n" href="ar13s04.html" shape="rect">Next</a></span></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="h" href="oxygen-main.html" shape="rect">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td></tr></table></div><div class="footer">Generated by<a class="oxyFooter" href="http://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_webhelp.html" target="_blank" shape="rect">
