        with validation seemed straight forward. Unluckily we hit a first wall when we tried to
        reimplement the initial transformation with XSL. The transformation is done by a PHP script
        that uses a mixture of string concatenation and DOM manipulation to create the structural
        metadata document. From the looks of it the conversion script was developed for an earlier
        project (i.e. the <span class="productname">Digital Incunabula Collection</span>) and later
        modified by adding one special case after another. We decided to skip the first
        transformation and start with the structural metadata document instead. This didn't work
        either: The transformation from TEI to Emblem Schema ran but didn't return anything. As a
        last resort we the turned to the Emblem Schema documents and it was when some of those
        didn't validate against the Emblem Schema we decided to take a step back and start a deeper
        investigation. </p><p>
        The library engaged in the creation of digital content since the late nineties, specifically in the creation of
        resources for digital emblem studies since the early 2000s. Not surprisingly the overall biggest problem we
        faced was the lack of proper documentation. Although we were lucky to still have staff around that was involved
        in the projects back then we had to resort to a certain amount of guesswork regarding the reasons why documents
        looked the way they did. Human memory turned out to be unreliable and no substitute for proper
        documentation. Having an XML database at hand to run queries across the documents helped a lot. What struck us
        as odd was that even though documents were associated with a DTD or a schema the DTD or schema was not used to
        actually validate the documents. This meant that we had to base our guesses on existing transformation and
        processing scripts, the source items, and anecdotal evidence.

        All in all we found the following flaws in our data and processes.
