      thought would be a short routine to write a moderately long
      regular expression. Because I had used Perl for this in the past,
      and because Perl is interpreted (and thus an easy language with
      which to perform rapid cycles of tweak-and-test), I wrote this
      program in Perl. This, I now believe, was a mistake.</p><p>The immediate output of the program was to be a regular
      expression — that is, a string — which I imagined I would
      generate once (after building and debugging the generation
      routine) and copy into an appropriate schema. Thus a string
      manipulation language like Perl seemed appropriate. However, in
      my zeal I forgot a universal truth about writing programs, even
      simple ones: they need to be <span class="emphasis"><em>tested</em></span> and
      <span class="emphasis"><em>debugged</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>repeatedly</em></span>
      and <span class="emphasis"><em>thoroughly</em></span>. In this case each round of
      testing required that the string be copied from standard output
      into a schema against which some test data could be validated.
      (Remember that I could not use Perl to directly test the regular
      expression against test data, because I was not generating a
      Perl-flavored regular expression, but rather an W3C-flavored
      regular expression.) Thus in order to save time, it made sense
      for the program to either insert the regular expression into the
      test schema for me, or to write a complete test schema (that
      includes the regular expression) anew each time it was run.
      While the former technique is perhaps more desirable from a
      point of view of separation of concerns, the latter is much
      easier to write and is preferable insofar as it keeps all the
      concerns (as it were) in one file.</p><p>My preferred schema languages are RELAX NG and ISO
      Schematron,<a href="#ftn.d5e6574" class="footnote" shape="rect"><sup class="footnote" id="d5e6574">[38]</sup></a> either of which can be
      used to test the value of <code class="code">tei:rendition/@selector</code>
      against a W3C-flavored regular expression. Thus I soon modified
      the generation program so that instead of writing just a regular
      expression to standard output, it wrote a small, but complete
      RELAX NG schema or a small, but complete, XSLT program, either of
      which was designed to test only the value of <code class="sgmltag-attribute">selector</code> against the (current version of)
      the generated regular expression.</p><p>The reason for generating XSLT output instead of ISO
      Schematron output was purely pragmatic. The Schematron processor I
      use works by converting the Schematron to an XSLT intermediate
      (using XSLT), and then transforming the test document using the
      intermediate XSLT. By writing XSLT directly from the generation
      program, I could save a conversion step during each test and still
      use the same engine to execute the regular expression.</p><p>Details about the design of the output RELAX NG schema and
      XSLT program follow. But their mere existence explains why my
      use of Perl was a mistake. Both of the desired output formats
      were XML, and for me XSLT is the best language to use for
      generating XML as output.<a href="#ftn.d5e6580" class="footnote" shape="rect"><sup class="footnote" id="d5e6580">[39]</sup></a> (Even
      those who do not think of XSLT as the <span class="emphasis"><em>best</em></span>
      language for writing XML will admit that it is far better than
      Perl.)</p><div class="footnotes"><br clear="none" /><hr style="width:100; text-align:left;margin-left: 0" /><div id="ftn.d5e6574" class="footnote"><p><a href="#d5e6574" class="para" shape="rect"><sup class="para">[38] </sup></a>That is, my preferred schema languages

      advantageous to use a language, like XSLT, that outputs a
      <span class="emphasis"><em>tree</em></span> in serial format as XML — rather than
      as a sequence of characters, some of which are pointy brackets —
      and thus <span class="emphasis"><em>cannot</em></span> make most well-formedness
      errors. Without such a language, simple well-formedness errors
      creep in constantly. Even in the 297 XML files that make up the
      XML version of the <a class="link" href="https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/CSS3/Selectors/current/" target="_top" shape="rect">W3C
      CSS3 Selectors Test Suite Index</a>, which look to me like
      they are generated by a program, I found four files with one
      well-formedness error each. (<span class="quote">“<span class="quote"><code class="code">&lt;br&gt;</code></span>”</span>
      without an end-tag in all four cases).</p></div></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><span class="navprev"><a accesskey="p" href="ar15s03.html" shape="rect">Prev</a></span> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="u" href="ar15s03.html" shape="rect">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> <span class="navnext"><a accesskey="n" href="ar15s03s02.html" shape="rect">Next</a></span></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="h" href="oxygen-main.html" shape="rect">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td></tr></table></div><div class="footer">Generated by<a class="oxyFooter" href="http://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_webhelp.html" target="_blank" shape="rect">
