He then showed it to some of the senior people in the organization where he works, and was shocked and disappointed at the responses he got. He had clearly done a lot of reading, worked hard, and build something to impress the powers that be. He wanted recognition, praise, and perhaps additional responsibilities. They laughed at him. </p><p>He is the son of a friend of a friend, so he felt safe asking me what had gone wrong.
            The first thing I told him is that the big thing he had done right was to dive in and
            learn about something he found interesting but knew nothing about. I thought that was
            laudable, and that spirit would serve him well in the future.</p><p>Now, let’s look at some of the problems with his XML vocabulary. He said that they laughed at him because:

They said good XML is about meaning, not about look and feel and that, when tagging regular documents, the formatting should be separate from the content.</span>”</span> </p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="bold"><strong>Types of Markup: </strong></span> <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">They talked about generic markup and
                        structural markup and containers and procedural markup (which they said was
                        <span class="quote">‘<span class="quote">deprecated</span>’</span> - a word I did not know but that sounds pretty snooty to
                        me).</span>”</span></p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="bold"><strong>Mixed Metaphors: </strong></span> <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">They told me I should not write my own vocabulary until I had made sure one of the <span class="quote">‘<span class="quote">standard</span>’</span> ones would not work for me. Hey, I started with DocBook, but my project is really special, and DocBook did not define all I needed. Then my librarian friend told me that the reference model in JATS is better than the one in DocBook, so I copied it in. Why can’t I do that?</span>”</span></p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="bold"><strong>Natural/Intuitive Tagging: </strong></span> <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">I also made my language a lot more natural by using tags from HTML whenever I could.

If this stuff  is so important to making good XML why doesn’t the XML specification talk about it?</span>”</span>   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="quote">“<span class="quote">If it’s not in the rec, how is a person supposed to know it’s important and how do I learn about it?</span>”</span> </p></li></ul></div><p>
