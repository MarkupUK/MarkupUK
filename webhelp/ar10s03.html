            let us first look at the challenges the XProc Working Group had to face in order to
            allow processing of non-XML documents. In XProc 1.0 everything that could possibly
            flow from the output port of one step to the input port of another step, was a
            well-formed XML document. And every step defined in the step library, if it has an input
            port at all, it has an XML input port. This situation changes dramatically, once it was
            decided, that not only XML-documents could flow, but a wide variety of documents of
            different flavors. Then we have to differentiate between steps which could handle a
            certain kind of document, and steps, that have to raise an error because they could not
            possible do something useful with the document kind in question: Adding an attribute
            with a certain name and a certain value clearly only makes sense, when the document in
            question is an XML document. We do not even know what it could possibly mean to add an
            attribute to a text document or an image. Of course getting the image dimensions only
            makes sense of an image, but not for a text document or an XML document.</p><p>The other side of the same coin is a situation, when a pipeline author by accident
            exposes an image document to a step, that expects an XML document. Parsing an image
            document with an XML parser will most certainly lead into an error and the pipeline
            breaks. To be able to debug this kind of situation it is most useful not to get the
            information, that something is wrong with the XML document, as the parser will tell us,
            but to state, that a non-XML document appeared somewhere, where only an XML document is
            allowed. Thirdly, from the perspective of an XProc processor, it is important to know
            the kind of document it is dealing with, so it can choose an internal data model, that
            is suitable for the document type in question and for the operations defined for
            documents of this type.</p><p>The practical upshot of this reasoning is, that we need two things: We need to know
            what type a specific document has and we need a label for XProc steps, to say what
            kind(s) of documents they can deal with or allow on their specific input ports. </p><p>In order to cope with these two requirements, the XProc Working Group had to develop a
            completely new understanding of what flows on an XProc pipeline from step to step. What
            flows is still called "a document", but a document is now <span class="emphasis"><em>a pair</em></span>
            consisting of <span class="emphasis"><em>a representation</em></span> and the <span class="emphasis"><em>document
                properties</em></span>. The representation is a processor specific data structure
            which is used to refer to the actual document content. The document properties are pairs
            of keys and values containing metadata of the content. The type or kind of the document
            flowing between the steps is the most important metadata and it is associated with the
            key <code class="literal">content-type</code>. XProc 3.0 uses the well known media type
            notation like <code class="literal">application/xml</code>, <code class="literal">text/plain</code>,
                <code class="literal">image/jpeg</code> and so on, to distinguish different types of
            documents.</p><p>Steps in XProc 3.0 now also use the media type notation to declare, which kind of
            documents are expected on a specific port. If a document that matches the step's
            specification arrives, everything is fine: The step can perform the expected operation
            and new documents (pairs of representation and document-properties) are produced on the
            step's output ports. But if an incoming document does not match the content-types
            expected by a step on a specific port, an specific error is raised by the processor,
            telling e.g. that step <code class="literal">add-attribute</code> expects a document with one of
            the media types <code class="literal">application/xml</code>, <code class="literal">text/xml</code> or 
            <code class="literal">application/*+xml</code> but a
            document with content-type <code class="literal">text/plain</code> was found. Which content-types
            are expected on which ports is of course determined by the inner logic of the step:
            Steps like <code class="literal">p:identity</code> can obviously deal with any kind of document
            because it only passes through the documents appearing on this input port. The same is
            true for <code class="literal">p:count</code> which counts the number of documents on an input
            port and does not have to know, what kind of documents they are. But most steps known
            from the XProc 1.0 step library typically require a document with an XML media type
            to appear on its input ports, because adding an attribute, replacing an element,
            renaming a namespace etc. only makes sense for XML documents.</p><p>The new concept of a “document” in XProc 3.0 consisting of a representation of a
            content of a certain type and the document properties as its metadata as we will see
            nicely solves the problem of opening up the well known XProc conception to non-XML
            documents. Regardless of the type of the documents, they are produced by a step and
            exposed on one of its output ports. The XProc processor then sends them to another
            step's input ports and will raise an error, if the document's type does not belong to
            the types of documents the step in question is able to deal with. The processor is able
            to do this, because the document properties flow with the documents between the ports
            and so a step <span class="emphasis"><em>knows</em></span> what type of document is coming in.</p><p>But what about the pipeline author, how is she able to access the document properties?
            You can easily imagine situations where a pipeline author might want to make a decision
            based on the type of the document, for example because the output of a certain step
            should be sent to step <code class="literal">A</code> if it is an image, but to step
                <code class="literal">B</code> if it is of some other type. To make this kind of processing
            possible, the document properties of a document are exposed to the pipeline author via a
            bunch of XPath functions making mostly use of the <code class="literal">map</code> type introduced
            with XPath 3.1 <a class="xref" href="bi10.html#XPath_31_functions" title="XPath and XQuery Functions and Operators 3.1" shape="rect">[2]</a>. More precisely the document properties are represented as
                <code class="literal">map(xs:QName, item())</code> and you can access them as a map by using
            the XProc extension function <code class="literal">p:document-properties($doc)</code>. Most of the
            time pipeline authors will not be interested in the full map, but want to retrieve a
            specific value. This can be done using <code class="literal">p:document-property($doc,
                $key)</code>. And finally there is a function called
                <code class="literal">p:document-properties-document($doc)</code> which returns an XML
            document for the document properties of the document in question. In this document each
            key of the map becomes an element and the value of the key becomes the element's values.
            In this way pipeline authors can retrieve and evaluate the document properties of a
            document using just familiar XPath expressions and do not need to use the new
            expressions introduced for maps and arrays.</p><p>Now that we have seen how the document properties of a document in XProc 3.0 are
            accessed the question may come up, how to control or set the document properties in a
            pipeline. Typically in most cases you do not have to do this, because the XProc
            processor is responsible for this: If a step declares the documents on an output port to
            be, say of type <code class="literal">text/plain</code>, the document properties of the resulting
            documents are set by the processor accordingly. But sometimes obviously pipeline author
            need to control the document properties themselves, e.g. when you are loading a document
            and do not trust your file system to get the mime type of the document right. Another
            use case for setting document properties in a pipeline is when you create a document
            inline and want to tell the processor explicitly which document type the document has to
            have. For those cases XProc 3.0 provides an additional option named
                <code class="literal">document-properties</code> which takes a map with document's metadata as
            its values. Finally, if you need to add additional metadata to a document created by one
            step before it goes into another step, there is a new step called
                <code class="literal">p:p:set-properties</code>, which can be used to overwrite existing
            metadata or add additional data to the document properties.</p><p>Having talked about the new concept of a document being a pair of a representation and its
            document properties and having discussed the document properties to some extent, the
            next thing we have to cover is the representation part of the document pair. As said
            above, the representation is a data structure used by the processor to refer to the
            document's content. Which representation a processor has to use in order to deal with
            the content of the document is defined based on the document's media type. The current
            version of the specs (May-2018) calls out four different types of representations:
            Obviously there are <span class="emphasis"><em>XML documents</em></span> identified by an XML media type,
            which is “<code class="literal">application/xml text/xml application/*+xml</code>”. Secondly the
            specs mention <span class="emphasis"><em>text documents</em></span> which are identified by media type
                “<code class="literal">text/*</code>”. Thirdly there are <span class="emphasis"><em>JSON documents</em></span>
            which have media type “<code class="literal">application/json</code>” and forth there are the so
            called <span class="emphasis"><em>binary documents</em></span> which are identified by any media type not
            mentioned yet. Implementers are obviously free to implement additional document types
            identified by media types, as long as they do not conflict with the ones mentioned
            before.</p><p>As we learned before, the XProc 3.0 specification defines a
                <span class="emphasis"><em>representation</em></span> for documents of a specific media type, where
            "representation" means <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">a data structure used by an XProc processor to refer to
                the actual document content</span>”</span>. And this brings us to another important change,
            the XProc working group decided to make for XProc 3.0, because they say in the
            specs:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Representations of XML documents are instances of the XQuery 1.0 and XPath 2.0 
  			Data Model (XDM).</p></blockquote></div><p>Therefore XProc 3.0 uses the same data model as other XML related technologies like
            XQuery or XSLT. And this is a strong change in the concept of what an XML document is.
            In XProc 1.0 the concept of a well-formed XML document was used, i.e. every
            document had exactly one element node, optionally preceded and/or followed by comment
            nodes, processing instructions and all whitespace text nodes. Well-formed XML documents
            are fine, but the stipulation, that every XML document has to be well-formed all the
            times is very burdensome when you try to make even very slight modifications. One thing
            I ran in a lot of times for one specific project, was the problem to add a
            processing-instruction as first node of the preamble, so the browser could recognize the
            XForms in the produced documents. This might sound like an easy task for someone
            familiar with XQuery or XSLT, but in XProc 1.0 it was tricky. The natural choice is
            of course <code class="literal">p:insert</code> where one matches the root element of the
            document, and tell the processor to insert the processing instruction before the root
            element. But you can not do this, because <code class="literal">p:insert</code> inserts
                <span class="emphasis"><em>documents</em></span> into other documents, <span class="emphasis"><em>not nodes</em></span>.
            So you can not insert a processing instruction, but have to insert either a processing
            instruction followed by a dummy element node or wrap the processing instruction into an
            element node in order to fulfill the “well-formed documents only” rule. But obviously
            you can not insert this document before the current element node of the document,
            because a well-formed document can not have two top level elements. So here is one way
            of doing this:</p><pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve"><strong class="hl-tag" style="color: #000096">&lt;p:wrap-sequence</strong> <span class="hl-attribute" style="color: #F5844C">wrapper</span>=<span class="hl-value" style="color: #993300">"dummy"</span><strong class="hl-tag" style="color: #000096"> /&gt;</strong>

            one can do it in the most natural way:</p><pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve"><strong class="hl-tag" style="color: #000096">&lt;p:insert</strong> <span class="hl-attribute" style="color: #F5844C">match</span>=<span class="hl-value" style="color: #993300">"/"</span> <span class="hl-attribute" style="color: #F5844C">position</span>=<span class="hl-value" style="color: #993300">"first-child"</span><strong class="hl-tag" style="color: #000096">&gt;</strong>

  <strong class="hl-tag" style="color: #000096">&lt;/with-input&gt;</strong>
<strong class="hl-tag" style="color: #000096">&lt;p:insertion&gt;</strong></pre><p>The second document type, which is newly introduced with XProc 3.0, is a
                <span class="emphasis"><em>text document</em></span>. Text documents are characterized by a media type
            that matches the scheme <code class="literal">text/*</code>, with the exception of
                <code class="literal">text/xml</code>, which is an XML document. Constructing a new text
            document is as easy as constructing an XML document:</p><pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve"><strong class="hl-tag" style="color: #000096">&lt;p:identity&gt;</strong>
  <strong class="hl-tag" style="color: #000096">&lt;p:with-input&gt;</strong>

      &gt;</strong>This is a new text document<strong class="hl-tag" style="color: #000096">&lt;/inline&gt;</strong>
  <strong class="hl-tag" style="color: #000096">&lt;/p:with-input&gt;</strong>
<strong class="hl-tag" style="color: #000096">&lt;/p:identity&gt;</strong></pre><p>The XProc processor will produce a new text document on the output port of
                <code class="literal">p:identity</code>. This document will consist of a document node with
            just one text node child which holds the text. Doing the representation of text
            documents in this way has the obvious advantage that it fits perfectly with the use of
            XPath as an expression language in XProc. Suppose you have a sequence of text documents
            and for some reason you want to treat text document differently whose second word is
                “<code class="literal">is</code>”. Since the text documents in XProc are a special kind of a
            document as defined in XDM, you can do it as easy as this:</p><pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve"><strong class="hl-tag" style="color: #000096">&lt;p:choose&gt;</strong>
  <strong class="hl-tag" style="color: #000096">&lt;p:when</strong> <span class="hl-attribute" style="color: #F5844C">test</span>=<span class="hl-value" style="color: #993300">"tokenize(.,'/s')[2]='is'"</span><strong class="hl-tag" style="color: #000096">&gt;</strong>
    <em class="hl-comment" style="color: silver">&lt;!-- ... --&gt;</em>
  <strong class="hl-tag" style="color: #000096">&lt;/p:when&gt;</strong>
  <em class="hl-comment" style="color: silver">&lt;!-- ... --&gt;</em>
 <strong class="hl-tag" style="color: #000096">&lt;/p:choose&gt;</strong></pre><p>To represent text documents as a text node wrapped into a document node also allows us
            to use them in <code class="literal">p:wrap-sequence</code> to wrap an element node around the
            text and thereby produce an XML document. Of course you can also use
                <code class="literal">p:insert</code> to insert the text node of a text document as a child of
            an already existing element node. And finally, if you select from an XML document and
            the resulting nodes are all text nodes, the XProc processor will create a new text
            document for you. We will see more applications for text documents when we come to
            discuss our example workflow in more detail, but for now we can record, that text
            documents in XProc 3.0 are pretty well integrated into the XML universe.</p><p>Next up is <span class="emphasis"><em>JSON</em></span>. Integrating JSON into the XML world was a high
            priority during the last years and great work has been done to archieve this goal with
            the new standards of XDM 3.1 and XPath 3.1. If you take a look at
            XSLT 3.0 you will find that working with JSON feels almost as natural as working
            with XML. Based on the cited works, JSON is now also integrated into XProc 3.0. As
            you might expect from the preceding discussion, it is called a “<code class="literal">JSON
                document</code>”. The document properties of a JSON document have a content-type
            entry that contains a JSON media type like “<code class="literal">application/json</code>”. As
            JSON is a text based format, you can easily construct JSON documents within XProc
            pipelines:</p><pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve"><strong class="hl-tag" style="color: #000096">&lt;p:identity&gt;</strong>

 <strong class="hl-tag" style="color: #000096">&lt;/p:identity&gt;</strong></pre><p>As you might expect, if you are familiar with the treatment of JSON in XPath, the
            XProc processor will use the function <code class="literal">fn:parse-json()</code> on the string
            supplied and produce an XDM representation of this JSON document. In the given case it
            will obviously be a map item with one entry mapping a string to an array item containing
            two strings.</p><p>Now this representation is perfectly in accordance with what you might expect if you
            come from an XPath, XQuery or XSLT background, however it does not quite fit with the
            XProc concept of documents flowing between input and output ports. And this is because
            the representation of the JSON document is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> an instance of an
            XDM node, but a map item (or an array item or an atomic value in other cases). And
            neither a map item nor an array or an atomic value can be the child of a document node
            per XDM. If you recall the definition of an XProc document you can now understand, why
            it is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> defined as a pair of document properties and a node
            (which is true for XML and text documents), but as a pair of document properties and a
                <span class="emphasis"><em>representation</em></span>. The representation for some document types
                <span class="emphasis"><em>might be</em></span> an XDM node, but as for JSON documents it is
            not.</p><p>Let us take a closer look how this concept of a document fits into XProc and XPath.
            First of all, our JSON document produced on <code class="literal">p:identity</code> flows out of
            the step on an output port which is typically connected to the input port of some other
            step. As said above, what happens then depends on whether the receiving step accepts a
            JSON document on the respective input port. For example if it is a
                <code class="literal">p:store</code> the document will be written to some destination as you
            might expect. But if the receiving step is e.g. a <code class="literal">p:add-attribute</code> a
            dynamic error will occur, because a JSON document is not allowed on the input port of
            this step. But this is nothing special for JSON documents but applies to all documents
            in XProc. If, for example, an XML document appears on an input port that only allows
            JSON documents to flow in, a dynamic error is raised too.</p><p>As you can see, JSON documents are first class citizens in XProc 3.0 when it
            comes to the question of what can flow between steps. But if you are familiar with
            XProc, you might recall, that documents do not only flow between steps, but can also
            appear as context items when it comes to evaluating XPath expressions. Here JSON
            documents do not fit quite as well, because their content is not represented as
            something which is an XDM node and therefore an XPath expression like
                <code class="literal">"/"</code> can not expose the content to XPath. For
                <code class="literal">"/"</code> the XProc processor is required to construct an empty
            document node, so <code class="literal">p:document-properties('/')</code> will return the document
            properties of JSON documents as well. To overcome this problem is obviously very easy if
            you imagine an XProc defined XPath function, which takes the document node associated
            with the JSON document as a parameter and returns the same representation of the JSON
            document as XPath's <code class="literal">fn:json-doc()</code> would. As of May 2018 you will not
            find such a function in the specifications for XProc 3.0, but I am pretty sure the
            community group now taking care of XProc's development will find some way to bridge the
            gap between JSON documents and XPath expressions.</p><p>Finally XProc 3.0 defines a fourth document type called “<span class="emphasis"><em>binary
                document</em></span>”. A binary document is actually <span class="emphasis"><em>anything</em></span>
            which is not either an XML document, or a text document or a JSON document, or, more
            precisely which has a media type not associated with these three document types. This
            document type sums up such different kinds of data as ZIP-archives, all kinds of images,
            PDF-documents and every thing else we have on our file systems or receive from web
            services. As for JSON documents the XProc processor is required to construct an empty
            document node, so <code class="literal">p:document-properties('/')</code> will return the document
            properties associated with this document. How a binary document is represented
            internally by an XProc processor is <span class="emphasis"><em>implementation defined</em></span>. And it
            is obvious that not all binary documents will be internally represented in the same way
            by an advanced XProc processor: Smaller documents will probably be held in memory for
            fast access, but if you think about very large documents (as a video or an audio file),
            some optimization will be necessary. One strategy is to store those files away in a
            temporary folder and let just references to these files flow between the steps. Only if
            a step actually needs to access the document's content, the file or parts of it are
            loaded by the XProc processor.</p><p>Because the representation of binary documents has to be implementation defined,
            XProc 3.0 currently defines no way to access the document's content within an XPath
            expression. One can easily imagine an XProc defined XPath function returning the
            document's content as <code class="literal">xs:base64Binary</code> or as
                <code class="literal">xs:hexBinary</code>. But the main problem here is, that in most cases
            you do not want the whole document content, but are only interested in a smart portion
            of it. For this reason an implementation returning the whole content, which may be very
            large, and then use XPath expressions to identify the small range the pipeline author is
            really interested in, would be very inefficient. This problem is not impossible to
            solve, but the XProc community has not agreed on a solution yet. One way to solve it
            would to determine the content's size, either as part of the metadata in the
            document-properties or as a function taking the binary document as argument. This might
            be complemented by an XProc defined XPath function which allows to select a part of the
            document's content. The specification of the EXPath binary module could certainly be a
            role model for solving this
            problem.[<span class="citation">Kosek:Lumley:Binary:Module:1.0</span>]</p><p>Together with the new document model, XProc 3.0 introduces a new step to convert
            or cast the different document types into each other:
                <code class="literal">p:cast-content-type</code>. This step takes an arbitrary document on its
            input port and the content-type this document should be casted to and returns a casted
            document on the output port (or throws an error if the XProc processor is not able to
            perform the requested casting). This abstract characterization is necessary, because
            this step is a kind of “Jack of all trades” of document processing in XProc. The easiest
            task this step can perform, is to cast from one XML media type to another, say from
                “<code class="literal">application/xslt+xml</code>” to “<code class="literal">application/xml</code>” or
            vice versa. Here the actual document representation does not need to be changed in any
            way, just the value of key <code class="literal">content-type</code> in the document properties
            needs to be changed. Casting from a non-XML document type to an XML document type will
            produce an XML document by wrapping the representation of the non-XML document into a
                <code class="literal">c:data</code>-element. This type of casting is well known from
            XProc 1.0, where the element <code class="literal">p:data</code> on an input port was
            responsible for converting non-XML to XML.</p><p>The step <code class="literal">p:cast-content-type</code> can also perform the opposite casting
            from an XML document with a <code class="literal">c:data</code>-element with encoded data as a
            child to the respective document type. All other conversions between media types are
            currently implementation defined. In this area some more work needs to be done, for
            example when it comes to cast a JSON document to an XML document. The current version
            (May-2018) of the XProc 3.0 specification defines that is has to result in a
                <code class="literal">c:data</code>-document with a base64-encoded representation of the JSON
            content.  In <em class="citetitle">XPath and XQuery Functions and Operators 3.1</em><a class="xref" href="bi10.html#XPath_31_functions" title="XPath and XQuery Functions and Operators 3.1" shape="rect">[2]</a> we find a
            mapping from JSON to XML which is used in the two functions
                <code class="literal">fn:json-to-xml()</code> and <code class="literal">fn:xml-to-json()</code>. Making
            use of this mapping when it comes to casting a JSON document to an XML document and vice
            versa in XProc 3.0 is certainly an idea that should be discussed. In this line of
            thought we might also have a mapping from text document with media type
                “<code class="literal">text/csv</code>” to an XML document and vice versa. But some of the
            possible casting tasks to be performed by <code class="literal">p:cast-content-type</code> could
            definitively be scary. Let me just mention the case when an XML document with media type
                “<code class="literal">image/svg+xml</code>” should be casted to
                “<code class="literal">image/jpeg</code>”.</p><p>This much on the new concepts (and steps) introduced by XProc 3.0 to escape the
            XML-only limitation and to allow the design of XProc workflows for non-XML documents.
            Let us now come back to the use case shortly introduced at the beginning of this paper
            and discover the practical aspects of non-XML workflows in XProc 3.0.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><span class="navprev"><a accesskey="p" href="ar10s02.html" shape="rect">Prev</a></span> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="u" href="ar10.html" shape="rect">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> <span class="navnext"><a accesskey="n" href="ar10s04.html" shape="rect">Next</a></span></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="h" href="oxygen-main.html" shape="rect">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td></tr></table></div><div class="footer">Generated by<a class="oxyFooter" href="http://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_webhelp.html" target="_blank" shape="rect">
