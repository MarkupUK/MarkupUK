			HTML into XML. There are two primary versions:
				1.<span class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> and 5. Version 5 is the current
			version, and is an XML syntax for HTML 5. The original XHTML 1
			versions supported customization using XML DTDs, the original
			mechanism to define an XML vocabulary. XHTML 5 does not use
			grammar-based validation, and is primarily intended for use in Web
			browsers.  XHTML is also used by the EPUB standard for electronic
			books, where it has the advantage that a device-specific rendering
			engine can be used without having to worry about full HTML
			compatibility. This is important because Web browsers tend to be
			very flexible in displaying files containing errors, so existing
			content often contains a lot of syntax errors, which in turn means
			any software that tries to process arbitrary HTML needs a relatively
			complex parser and a lot of compatibility code. With XHTML, the
			syntax checking is strict, and enforced by the XML parser.</p><p>Since XHTML files can be read by XML parsers, they are amenable to
			processing with XSLT and XProc, and to being stored in databases and
			queries with XQuery. Modern versions of XSLT and XQuery can also
			create XHTML 5 files.</p><p>XHTML, like HTML, is designed in the context of Web browsers. Like
			all software, Web browsers evolve. Over time, elements change
			meaning or are dropped entirely. However, HTML 5 dropped the idea of
			including a version number in HTML files, which may cause problems
			with long-term archiving. Of course, any vocabulary could change
			over time, but the mitigation there is to combine grammar-based
			validation and specific version marking; HTML and XHTML do
			neither.</p><p>XHTML is good for projects at the edge of XML and the Web, because
			they are equally usable by both tool-sets. The element names are
			also understood by Web search engines, so that serving XHTML files
			directly on the open Web makes sense and works. XHTML 5 is a good
			choice for generic documents such as blogs, as well as for Web-based
			applications. It has deficiencies in validation compared to
			domain-specific vocabularies, but it would also be fair to consider
			XHTML to be a domain-specific XML vocabulary for sharing documents
			on the World Wide Web. The name (X)HTML is sometimes used to refer
			to the vocabulary independently of whether the XML or slightly
			different HTML syntax is used.</p><p>If you are producing your own domain-specific vocabulary, it is
			worth considering using (X)HTML 5 element names for plain text
			paragraphs and for markup within them, simply because (X)HTML is,
			overall, the most widely-used vocabulary on the planet. However,
			beware of false promises: if you use <span class="emphasis"><em>p</em></span> for
			paragraphs, people may expect to be able to use
				<span class="emphasis"><em>ol</em></span> for a list, <span class="emphasis"><em>i</em></span> for
			italics, and so on.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><span class="navprev"><a accesskey="p" href="ar14s07.html" shape="rect">Prev</a></span> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="u" href="ar14.html" shape="rect">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> <span class="navnext"><a accesskey="n" href="ar14s09.html" shape="rect">Next</a></span></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="h" href="oxygen-main.html" shape="rect">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td></tr></table></div><div class="footer">Generated by<a class="oxyFooter" href="http://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_webhelp.html" target="_blank" shape="rect">
