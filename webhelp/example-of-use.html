      The usefulness of this library to the content delivery team can
      best be illustrated through the example of the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">content
      migration</span>”</span> sub-team. This team acts as a bridge between the
      editorial function and the fabrication pipelines (which
      subsequently deliver content for delivery to users of the main
      product web page). The content is mastered in XML using a variety
      of DTDs but the definitions in these DTDs are quite broad, in the
      sense that several different types of content can be represented
      using the same DTD. However, for delivery to the production
      systems certain additional rules must be enforced—these rules
      (written in Schematron) <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">tailor</span>”</span> the broad DTD
      definition for each particular content type.
    </p><p>
      The Schematron rules effectively represent the editorial
      requirements for the content—there are many of them and they
      change quite often. The content migration sub-team develops and
      maintains these Schematron rules, supplying them to the
      fabrication team for inclusion in the various pipelines related to
      those content types. Prior to the development of the Ant library
      the typical workflow was something like:
    </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist compact" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
          Find the appropriate build.xml file and edit it, commenting
          out details of other team members content types and
          un-commenting their own.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          Find another, apparently unrelated build.xml file (e.g. with a
          relative path similar to
          <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">../../common/build.xml</span>”</span>) and make similar
          changes.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          Run the first build file to create a pre-compiled Schematron
          file (i.e. an XSLT).
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          Manually move the output file to a different folder.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          Inform the fabrication team that there is a new version of the
          file.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          Liaise with fabrication to correct any issues found during the
          next run of the content through its pipeline. This may include
          confirming which version of the code is being included and
          re-compiling if necessary.
        </p></li></ol></div><p>
      Note that as all code was shared in the same TFS repository it was
      very difficult to go back and check the status of any particular
      version. Different versions were not explicitly labelled and any
      changes to the code might be overwritten by another team member
      committing to the same files in the same repository.
    </p><p>
      Therefore, after the Ant library was developed a second, higher
      level set of macros was developed to assist the content migration
      sub-team. The Schematron files for each content stream were placed
      in their own Git repository and which had its own (Ant) properties
      file that described how the Schematron files should be compiled
      and the various options that should be applied. A standard
      template for a <span class="strong"><strong>build.xml</strong></span> file
      common to all the content streams was also created. The workflow
      now became:
    </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist compact" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
          Create a new feature branch in the repository and make the
          code changes required.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          From a command line run <code class="literal">$ ant compile</code> to
          compile the Schematron files (using the
          <code class="literal">compile-schematron</code> macros).
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          Run <code class="literal">$ ant validate</code> to validate the compiled
          Schematron against a representative data model, or series of
          models (using the <code class="literal">validate-schematron</code>
          macros).
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          Merge the feature changes back into master (and repeat from
          step 1 for additional features).
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          Once all features have been finished create a
          <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">release</span>”</span> branch,
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          Run the validation tasks once more. If all the tests are valid
          then run <code class="literal">$ ant version</code> to update the
          version number—this version number is now embedded in the
          compiled Schematron.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          Prepare release documentation and run
          <code class="literal">$ ant docs</code> to prepare it. This
          documentation will be deployed with the compiled Schematron
          files so that all content developers can see what changes have
          been made and why. The build file will check that this
          documentation has been completed and will not deploy until it
          has.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          Run <code class="literal">$ ant deploy</code> to deploy the compiled
          Schematron files to the CAPE for reference as well as
          deploying them directly to a network share where the
          fabrication pipeline will pick it up automatically. This uses
          the <code class="literal">deploy-files</code> macros, but the standard
          build file will not allow deployment from other than a release
          branch or if there are outstanding commits. In other words,
          the developer cannot deploy simply <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">as a
          test</span>”</span>—they must think about their actions.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          Merge the feature branch back into master and push to the
          server to keep a record of all changes.
        </p></li></ol></div><p>
      This freed up the content migration sub-team to concentrate on the
      details of the content and the Schematron rules, dealing with
      actual content issues rather having to continually having to
      manually configure build files at each step. Furthermore, the
      addition of a version number meant that any errors encountered in
      the fabrication pipeline were much easier to track and resolve. Of
      course, some of these improvements are directly related to the
      enforcement of the Development Policy—but most of the time this is
      accomplished <span class="emphasis"><em>automatically</em></span> through the Ant
      library macros.
