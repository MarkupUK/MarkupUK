Quite a lot. We've learned about things that
    work well, we've learned about how to take best advantage of some of the new constructs in the
    language, we've generated ideas for further refinements to the language specs (some of which
    were implemented during the course of the study), and we've learned about areas where there
    is still room for further improvements.</p><p>Here's a list of some of the more important observations.</p><div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style=""><li class="listitem"><p>When converting XML to JSON, we discovered the importance of achieving a mapping
        that i consistent not only over a large collection of instance documents, but that is also
        consistent over time despite the fact that tomorrow's instance documents might not have
        exactly the same structure as today's. We redesigned the <code class="code">element-to-map</code>
        function to meet this requirement.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The plan constructed by the <code class="code">element-to-map-plan</code> function seems
          to work well on the samples we needed to convert, given a set of input documents
          that is sufficiently large and representative.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>We found that it's easiest to define template rules for maps if they can be
        written to depend only on the internal structure of the map, and not on the key
        used to identify the map within a larger structure. Whether this is possible depends
        on the design of the JSON to be tranformed. Writing match patterns of the form
        <code class="code">match="record(real, complex)</code> that recognise the type of a map
        from the names of its fields is often a good approach. Sometimes one would also
        like to match on the values of a field, for example 
          <code class="code">match="record(type, *)[?type="xxx']</code>. It would be nice to have
        syntax that's less clumsy for this. There's a temptation for users to reduce it
        to <code class="code">match=".[?type="xxx']</code> but this seems to lack clarity.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>XSLT often processes selected child elements or attributes by inline code
        within a template, and then processes the remainder using a construct such as
        <code class="code">&lt;xsl:apply-templates select="* except (X, Y, Z)"/&gt;</code> where
        <code class="code">X</code>, <code class="code">Y</code>, <code class="code">Z</code> are the children that have been given special treatment.
        The <code class="code">except</code> operator works only on nodes, and the lookup operator
        <code class="code">?</code> currently provides no similar capability to select all properties except
        some specifically-named ones. One option is to provide lower-priority template
        rules that match <code class="code">X</code>, <code class="code">Y</code>, and <code class="code">Z</code> and do nothing
        with them.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>For this and other reasons, it is often useful to match values appearing in a tree
        of maps and arrays by their associated key. The syntax <code class="code">match="?keyval"</code>
        has been proposed for this. The semantics, though, depend on values being labelled with
        their associated key, and the full complexities of this (and the usability problems that
        it might introduce) are not yet fully understood.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>It would be useful for the <code class="code">union</code>, <code class="code">except</code>, and <code class="code">intersect</code>
        operators in patterns to apply to all kinds of pattern, not only patterns that match nodes. (The semantics
        of these operators in a pattern have already diverged in detail from their XPath semantics.)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>It would be nice to have some equivalent to <code class="code">match="/"</code> to match the root of
        a tree.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>I had been concerned about how template rules should process arrays. The case study revealed no
        problems in this area. In most cases arrays are not processed by matching them in a template rule,
        but by iterating over the array in the template rule for its container.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The current syntax for constructing maps and arrays in XSLT is rather verbose, and could
        be improved for many common use cases. Sometimes the right answer is to do it in XPath:
        the introduction of the <code class="code">fn:apply-templates</code> function and the <code class="code">xsl:select</code>
        instruction both facilitate that. In other cases the new <code class="code">xsl:record</code> instruction
        helps. An equivalent to <code class="code">array:build</code> as an XSLT instruction has also been
        mooted.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Neither <code class="code">xsl:record</code> nor XPath map constructors make it easy to
        include an entry in the constructed map conditionally.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Pinned maps and arrays make access to containing (ancestor) arrays and maps possible,
        but the current syntax for doing so is very clumsy.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>We've added quite a lot of functionality to introduce modifiers for lookup expressions
        (such as <code class="code">$x?pair::y</code>). But this case study didn't identify any situations where
        they proved useful.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>When the JSON structure uses arrays of maps (which is quite common), paths such as
        <code class="code">?x?*?y?*?z</code> start to appear frequently (and are very hard to debug when they select
        nothing). Could this be improved?</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><span class="navprev"><a accesskey="p" href="ar04s06.html" shape="rect">Prev</a></span> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="u" href="ar04.html" shape="rect">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> <span class="navnext"><a accesskey="n" href="references.html" shape="rect">Next</a></span></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="h" href="oxygen-main.html" shape="rect">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td></tr></table></div><div class="footer">Generated by<a class="oxyFooter" href="http://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_webhelp.html" target="_blank" shape="rect">
