Where to begin? Let's
        see if we can prepare some guidelines.</p><div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style=""><li class="listitem"><p>If you're smart, you realize upfront that maybe, one day, you'll have to write documentation of some sort for the structure you're
            working on. And that means trying try to keep its complexity in check. Especially child constructions with lots of complicated nested
            choices, sequences, etc. are very hard to explain in a satisfactory way. KISS rules.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Please realize you're in a knowledge bubble. You know everything there is to know about the XML structure. Maybe you consider it
            trivial. But your reader does not. So, first and foremost, try to put yourself in the user's mind. What does he or she need to know to use
            things effectively? What is important and what are details? What does the reader <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> know?</p><p>To reach such a state of mind, the easiest you can do is step away from your project for a day or longer. Take it over the weekend,
            distract yourself a little. And then plunge in.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Once you've, at least partially, left your knowledge bubble, try to get into the one of the reader. Who is he or she? What background
            knowledge can we expect? What is your audience?</p><p>Since we're talking here about documenting XML structures, I think its safe to assume you're writing for a technical, knowledgeable
            audience. So don't overdo it and ramble about the syntax and semantics of XML in general, or what a schema is, a web-server or other
            generic concepts. Best to assume this is common knowledge. Writing about it will only annoy your audience and make them feel
            belittled.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>An often made mistake is to start explaining something without establishing what is <span class="emphasis"><em>for</em></span>. So you happily set out
            describing your structure's root element and all its attributes, but forget to tell the reader why he/she should bother anyway. Why is
            this XML structure there? What does it do in general? Where in the processing is it used?</p><p>So it's important to start with some <span class="emphasis"><em>narrative</em></span>. A few paragraphs that explain background, goal, usage and the
            likes in broad terms. Maybe even some diagram or flowchart?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Another thing I always like to see before plunging into the details is some <span class="emphasis"><em>example</em></span> (or more than one) of the
            structure we're talking about. What does it look like? How much of it do I already roughly understand? What's the style? It's like a
            starter when dining out or the trailer of a film.</p><p>But watch out: deciding on a good example is not easy at all. It must be more than trivial but not overly complicated. It should not
            bury the reader in frightening details. It should be geared towards some common use-case, one that many readers will recognize and
            understand and that is not too hard to explain. It must be illustrative.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Before you start explaining the nitty-gritty details of the XML structure, decide on a <span class="emphasis"><em>format</em></span>. It's not only
            irritating for the reader to find this element explained this way and another one very different, it will also make your writer's task
            miserable. This is analogues to programming without conventions. Just try to imagine how tiring it would be to have to come up with some
            original naming format every time you create a variable, function or class. Much easier to decide on something and stick to it.</p><p>Of course this leads to the question: what is a good, or at least sufficient, format? More about this later.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Since we're all XML-heads here, I don't think I have to explain the difference between markup and its presentation. So when you're
            documenting some non-trivial structure, invest time in setting up a tool-chain in which you can describe structures in a formal way that
            is subsequently converted into the nice diagrams and tables you want to show your readers. Don't create them by hand.</p><p>This is very important for maintenance reasons. Assume for instance you've decide to make extensive and beautiful tree diagrams of
            your XML structures using some manual drawing tool. The result is awesome and the likes start streaming in. But XML structures, like all
            software, tend to change over time. So you have to redo some of the drawings, which is a lot of work even for small changes. Nah, not now…
            The documentation starts lagging behind and probably dies in beauty one day.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>As strange as it may sound, when things get complicated, don't let slavishly following the format get in the way of being
            understandable. There are situations where your diagrams or formal descriptions will become hard to read and slight deviations from the
            format you've decided on will improve understandability. Two examples:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style=""><li class="listitem"><p>The XProc programming language has a <code class="code">&lt;p:choose&gt;</code> instruction. The (new 3.0) standard depicts it like
                this:</p><div class="figure" id="d5e5749"><p class="title"><strong>Figure 7. The <code class="code">&lt;p:choose&gt;</code> in the standard</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="75%"><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><img src="papers-2019/erik/figures/p-choose-1.png" width="100%" alt="The &lt;p:choose&gt; in the standard" /></td></tr></table></div></div></div><br class="figure-break" clear="none" /><p>Look at the construction for the child elements <code class="code">&lt;p:when&gt;</code> and <code class="code">&lt;p:otherwise&gt;</code>. It explains,
                formal and correct, that there must be at least a <code class="code">&lt;p:when&gt;</code> or a <code class="code">&lt;p:otherwise&gt;</code>. Let there be no
                doubt: standard's documents <span class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> be formal and correct, so here it's no problem. But what if you're documenting
                this? This whole construction with its parenthesis, +, ? and | marks is not really easy to understand for humans. It looks daunting,
                even while its meaning is quite simple.</p><p>So when I was writing the section about <code class="code">&lt;p:choose&gt;</code> for the XProc book, I decided to do it a little
                different:</p><div class="figure" id="d5e5763"><p class="title"><strong>Figure 8. The <code class="code">&lt;p:choose&gt;</code> in the XProc book</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="75%"><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><img src="papers-2019/erik/figures/p-choose-2.png" width="100%" alt="The &lt;p:choose&gt; in the XProc book" /></td></tr></table></div></div></div><br class="figure-break" clear="none" /><p>Somewhat further down followed by the remark:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style=""><li class="listitem"><p>A <code class="code">&lt;p:choose&gt;</code> must contain <span class="emphasis"><em>at least</em></span> one <code class="code">&lt;p:when&gt;</code> or a
                      <code class="code">&lt;p:otherwise&gt;</code>. In other words: a <code class="code">&lt;p:choose&gt;</code> without at least a single branch is not
                    allowed.</p></li></ul></div><p>So a simplified diagram, followed by some additional text explaining the border condition. Not formal, not technically exactly
                correct, but easier and quicker to understand. </p><p>These kinds of decisions are also driven by the <span class="emphasis"><em>importance</em></span> of what you're trying to tell. That a
                  <code class="code">&lt;p:choose&gt;</code> has <code class="code">&lt;p:when&gt;</code> and <code class="code">&lt;p:otherwise&gt;</code> children, yes, that's important.
                That there's a formal condition on there being at least one… duh. Who will ever want to write a <code class="code">&lt;p:choose&gt;</code> without
                one? You loose a little exactness but you gain a lot of understandability.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Sometimes possible attribute values are a list of discrete values, like for the <code class="code">visibility</code> attribute in following
                example.</p><div class="figure" id="d5e5788"><p class="title"><strong>Figure 9. An attribute with a discrete value list</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="100%"><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><img src="papers-2019/erik/figures/declare-step.png" width="100%" alt="An attribute with a discrete value list" /></td></tr></table></div></div></div><br class="figure-break" clear="none" /><p>That's OK when this list is small, but what if it becomes longer and overflows the line width? Since you've decided on a format
                where discrete value lists are part of the diagram, you might be tempted to put them all there. However, that would mess up the layout
                of the diagram <span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> would forfeit its purpose: a quick, single glance, overview of an element's structure.</p><p>A better solution here would be to list just a few values in the diagram, add an ellipsis (…) to signify this list is incomplete
                and list them (in a table) later on in the document.</p></li></ul></div></li></ul></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><span class="navprev"><a accesskey="p" href="ar12s03s01.html" shape="rect">Prev</a></span> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="u" href="ar12s03.html" shape="rect">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> <span class="navnext"><a accesskey="n" href="ar12s03s03.html" shape="rect">Next</a></span></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="h" href="oxygen-main.html" shape="rect">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td></tr></table></div><div class="footer">Generated by<a class="oxyFooter" href="http://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_webhelp.html" target="_blank" shape="rect">
