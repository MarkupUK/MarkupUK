                    <code class="code">book</code> node as source context. The context-propagator of the
                    <code class="code">title</code> child location should <span class="italic">not</span>
                select all <code class="code">title</code> nodes found in the source document, but a <span class="italic">particular</span>
                <code class="code">title</code> – the one which is child of the particular <code class="code">book</code>
                providing the source context of the <code class="code">publication</code>. The requirement
                captures a <span class="bold"><strong>semantic relationship</strong></span> between the
                    <code class="code">publication</code> and <code class="code">title</code> nodes under construction. If
                target node P and target node C have a certain semantic relationship R (here: C
                gives the title of P), then the source context of P and the source context of C
                should have the same semantic relationship R (the source context of C should give
                the title of the source context of P). Mapping alignments to navigations (thus: SAAT
                to SNAT) means selecting those instances of an alignment which have a particular
                semantic relationship with the source context of the parent instance. The semantic
                relationship is implicit - implied by a structural relationship, the parent-child
                relationship defined as part of the target document model.</p><p>As the semantic relationship guiding navigation is implicit, implied by a
                structural relationship between target nodes (parent-child), it must also be derived
                from a <span class="italic">structural relationship</span> between sources
                nodes. So we have arrived at the general question: how is the semantic relationship
                pertaining to a particular parent-child pair in the target document model translated
                into a structural relationship connecting source nodes, more precisely: leading from
                the source context of the parent node to a subset of the source alignment of the
                child location?</p><p>We start by considering a particular case for which an intuitive solution is
                easily found. Let P and C denote two target locations, where C represents child
                nodes of P. (Example: P = <code class="code">publication</code>, C = <code class="code">title</code>). Assume
                that the alignment of C is a child location of the alignment of P. (Example:
                alignment of P: <code class="code">book</code>, alignment of C: <code class="code">title</code>.) Then we may
                expect the parent-child relationship defined by the target document model to have
                similar semantics as the parent-child relationship between their alignments, as
                defined by the source document model. (Example: the child gives the title of the
                parent.) So we set up a first, preliminary rule: “if the alignments of parent and
                child locations are themselves parent and child locations, then set the
                context-propagator of the target child location to select all instances of the
                source child location which are child nodes of the source context of the parent
                node.” In our example, this rule would yield the desired result: the source context
                of the target <code class="code">title</code> would be the child node of the source node serving
                as the source context of the target <code class="code">publication</code> node. </p><p>Parent-child relationships are often modified by the insertion of intermediate
                nodes providing some sort of grouping. Therefore we might generalize our preliminary
                rule to select all instances of the target child locations’s alignment which are
                    <span class="italic">descendant</span> of the target parent node’s souce
                context. While this will cover many cases, this is a far cry from a general
                solution, as hierarchical relationships need not be preserved by the transformation.
                As an example, consider target documents focusing on authors and describing
                publications as child elements of the node representing an author</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><span class="navprev"><a accesskey="p" href="ar09s05s05.html" shape="rect">Prev</a></span> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="u" href="section-source-alignment-based-model.html" shape="rect">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> <span class="navnext"><a accesskey="n" href="ar09s05s07.html" shape="rect">Next</a></span></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="h" href="oxygen-main.html" shape="rect">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td></tr></table></div><div class="footer">Generated by<a class="oxyFooter" href="http://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_webhelp.html" target="_blank" shape="rect">
