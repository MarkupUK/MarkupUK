There were declarative
			systems built from Unix <span class="emphasis"><em>troff</em></span> macro libraries in the 1970s and
			1980s, and of course SGML, Scribe, LaTeX and many others attempt to be more or less
			declarative and more or less general ways to represent and process documents with
			computers.</p><p>The choice of which markup system to use should be based on clear well-understood
			criteria. These might include:</p><div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style=""><li class="listitem"><p>Which notation has a closest fit to the document or documents. For
						example, a document with a lot of mixed markup and running text will be more
						difficult to process in some systems than others, as will a multilingual
						document;</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Which notation has associated tools that perform the processing the
						project needs;</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Which system the developers like the most or hate the most;</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Which system will be most likely to have active support for the entire
						duration of the project;</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>What will be the costs and what will be the gains of each format;</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>What are all the other similar projects using.</p></li></ul></div><p>Very often, the emotional aspects of the decision outweigh the technical
			aspects. This paper primarily explores the technical aspects, but
			also provides the reader with some ammunition to make an effective
			presentation in the emotional arena.</p><p>The examples of criteria enumerated above do not include the
			single most important aspects of a decision: the context and the
			situation.  The <span class="emphasis"><em>context</em></span> is an emergent property
			of organizational culture, fashion, predicted usage, and much more;
			some of this is listed explicitly here and some not. The
				<span class="emphasis"><em>situation</em></span>, or the circumstances around the
			decision, must be viewed in terms of the wider context: instructions
			for identifying radioactive material in a nuclear power plant might
			have to be understood for a hundred years or more; a financial
			transaction must be archived for a period determined by a legal
			statute of limitation; British laws are written on vellum and stored
			in a stone tower in some cases for a thousand years or more. But
			over the lifetime of the information the context in which it is used
			may change: a financial record might be read by corporate accounting
			staff or, later, by a government auditor.</p><p>The available tools will vary, but the organization may have a
			legal need to make information available regardless of applications
			originally used to process it. Similarly, software applications,
			operating systems, even display and user interface hardware
			constraints, all change over time. But a bigger question is who
			determines the format: who determines what information is stored,
			and how, and how is it to be used. A document that is read by an
			application to configure user preferences is likely designed by a
			programmer; a transcription of a mediaeval manuscript is more likely
			to be represented in ways determined by the people working with the
			text itself rather than with any particular application.</p><p>The following sections attempt to identify good and less
			successful contexts for different markup formats, and, again, to
			provide ways of describing these contexts.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><span class="navprev"><a accesskey="p" href="ar14.html" shape="rect">Prev</a></span> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="u" href="ar14.html" shape="rect">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> <span class="navnext"><a accesskey="n" href="ar14s01s01.html" shape="rect">Next</a></span></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="h" href="oxygen-main.html" shape="rect">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td></tr></table></div><div class="footer">Generated by<a class="oxyFooter" href="http://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_webhelp.html" target="_blank" shape="rect">
