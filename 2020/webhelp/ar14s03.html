			exchange of knowledge representation. Linked Data conforms to the
			same model: triplets of (subject, relationship, object), where all
			three terms are URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers), so that if two
			triplets use the same URI for the same subject then the properties
			from both triples apply to it, and so on.</p><p>RDF is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> a model for documents. One can
			extract triplets from documents, but if it is to be useful the
			extraction is normally lossy: a list of the characters and places
			mentioned in a novel such as <em class="citetitle">Star Wars</em> is a
			common example, together with externally-derived triplets describing
			relationships such as <span class="emphasis"><em>was born at</em></span> or
				<span class="emphasis"><em>loves</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>caused to become
				frozen</em></span>. The list does not include every occurrence of
			every word in the novel, and the book cannot be reconstructed from
			the list. This example is very typical in its relationship to
			information, to the original book. Query languages such as GraphQL
			and SPARQL can then be used to explore the data and to support
			applications. Note that Linked Data may in many cases represent a
			complete data set, but even there the data is normally unordered,
			unlike words and paragraphs in writing.</p><p>A weakness of RDF is that triplets are not natively labeled as to
			their source. In practice a <span class="emphasis"><em>triple store</em></span> (a
			content management system for RDF) will normally extend the model to
			add permissions and information about who added each triple, but
			this is not normally accessible to the standard query languages. RDF
			stores may also support federated queries, in which case the
			additional information is not passed between systems, potentially
			leading to trust and security issues.</p><p>The RDF model is also used for the Really Simple Syndication
			format (RSS), so that RSS files are simple XML representations of an
			RDF data model.</p><p>RDF values are simple (atomic) strings: there is no direct support
			for mixed content such as running text in HTML, and text fragments
			containing element markup, such as one finds in RSS, have to be
			escaped and are treated by RDF systems as simple strings. RDF query
			languages tend to be weak in string processing, exacerbating
			difficulties here: you can’t generally use SPARQL to find all RSS
			feed items containing an HTML link to a given resource, for
			example.</p><p>Linked Data in all of its forms provides ways to think about
			property-based reasoning, and can be very useful when working with
			metadata, especially in conjunction with other document formats. </p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><span class="navprev"><a accesskey="p" href="ar14s02.html" shape="rect">Prev</a></span> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="u" href="ar14.html" shape="rect">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> <span class="navnext"><a accesskey="n" href="ar14s04.html" shape="rect">Next</a></span></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="h" href="oxygen-main.html" shape="rect">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td></tr></table></div><div class="footer">Generated by<a class="oxyFooter" href="http://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_webhelp.html" target="_blank" shape="rect">
