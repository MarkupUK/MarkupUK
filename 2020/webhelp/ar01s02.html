			Building Blocks<span id="_ftnref3"></span>[3], what are they? The European Union realise
			that internet and digital technologies are transforming our world. A true statement.
			They also see is that the digital landscape is becoming more diverse, creating
			challenges for cross-border interoperability and intercommunication. Europe is about
			working together but, Europeans still face barriers when using (cross-border) online
			tools and services. The implications are considerable. EU citizens can miss out on goods
			and services and businesses in the EU miss out on market potential, while also the
			different governments in EU cannot fully benefit from digital technologies. The EU has
			therefore described the Digital Single Market<span id="_ftnref4"></span>[4] (DSM)
			through which it aims to overcome these challenges by creating the right environment for
			digital networks and services to flourish. The DSM is not only achieved by setting the
			right regulatory conditions, but also by providing cross-border digital infrastructures
			and services. So, to support the DSM, the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) programme is
			funding a set of generic and reusable Digital Service Infrastructures (DSI), also known
			as Building Blocks. The CEF building blocks offer basic capabilities that can be reused
			in any European project to facilitate the delivery of digital public services across
			borders and sectors. Currently, there are eight building blocks: Big Data Test
			Infrastructure, Context Broker, eArchiving, eDelivery, eID, eInvoicing, eSignature and
			eTranslation. The main part of CEF is a Core Service Platform, provided and maintained
			by the European Commission. Depending on the building block, the Core Service Platform
			may include technical specifications, sample software and supporting services (funding
			for the European Commission). The CEF building blocks offer basic capabilities that can
			be used in any European project to facilitate the delivery of digital public services
			across borders. The basis for the CEF Building Blocks are interoperability agreements
			between European Union member states. The aim of the Building Blocks is thus to ensure
			interoperability between IT systems so that citizens, businesses and administrations can
			benefit from seamless digital public services wherever they may be in Europe.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="papers-2019/karin-jaime/Images/BuildingBlocks.PNG" width="536" alt="The Building block layers" /><div class="caption"><p>The Building block layers.</p></div></div><p>
			</p><p>For each building block the European Commission provides a Core Service Platform which
			consists of three layers:</p><div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style=""><li class="listitem"><p>At the core of each building block is a layer of technical specifications and
					standards that have to be complied with;</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>To facilitate the implementation of the technical specifications and
					standards, a layer of sample software that complies with them and is meant for
					reuse (for certain building blocks only);</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>To facilitate the adoption of the technical specifications and standards, a
					layer of services (e.g. conformance testing, help desks, onboarding services,
					etc.) meant for use (which varies depending on the Building Block).</p></li></ul></div><p>All this means that the Building Blocks can be combined and used in projects in any
			domain or sector at European, national or local level.</p><p><span id="_ftn2"></span>[2]<a class="link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/connecting-europe-facility" target="_top" shape="rect">https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/connecting-europe-facility</a></p><p><span id="_ftn3"></span>[3]<a class="link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/CEF+Digital+Home" target="_top" shape="rect">https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/CEF+Digital+Home</a></p><p><span id="_ftn4"></span>[4]<a class="link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en" target="_top" shape="rect">https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en</a></p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><span class="navprev"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s01.html" shape="rect">Prev</a></span> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="u" href="ar01.html" shape="rect">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> <span class="navnext"><a accesskey="n" href="ar01s03.html" shape="rect">Next</a></span></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="h" href="oxygen-main.html" shape="rect">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td></tr></table></div><div class="footer">Generated by<a class="oxyFooter" href="http://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_webhelp.html" target="_blank" shape="rect">
