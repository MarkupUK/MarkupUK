	      Identifier</em></span> was probably a good move, but
	    using a web <acronym class="acronym">URI</acronym> is nearly as bad. If
	    the <acronym class="acronym">GCA</acronym> had realised what they had in
	    the <acronym class="acronym">ISO</acronym> 9070 Registry, they could have
	    made a big difference. Formal ownership of Names is
	    important.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em><span class="productname">psgml</span> risks being
	      lost</em></span> because of the introduction of
	    <span class="productname">nxml-mode</span>, which handles only
	    <acronym class="acronym">RNG</acronym>, and has a very limited control
	    set, making it virtually unusable as a text-document
	    editor</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Although the <span class="emphasis"><em><span class="phrase">family-tree</span>
	      hierarchical box diagram representation</em></span> of
	    the schema or <acronym class="acronym">DTD</acronym> tree is common in
	    many <acronym class="acronym">XML</acronym> editors, none of them yet
	    appears to match the design, clarity, and ease of use of
	    <span class="productname">Near&amp;Far Designer</span></p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>The use of <acronym class="acronym">XML</acronym> in the web
	      browser</em></span> has never properly been supported by
	    the browser-makers, for the exact same reasons as the
	    original <acronym class="acronym">HTML</acronym> wasn’t. It has to some
	    extent been saved by <span class="productname">Saxon/CE</span>
	    and <span class="productname">Saxon/JS</span>, but the browsers
	    themselves are a lost cause</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Open Source software</em></span> (then
	    usually just called <em class="wordasword">free</em>) is no
	    better at surviving three decades than commercial
	    software. In fact, commercial software may have the edge,
	    in that it came in boxes, with manuals,
	    <acronym class="acronym">CD</acronym>s, dongles, licence keys, and other
	    stuff, so it got put on a shelf or into a cupboard.</p><p>However, most (but not all) web sites acting as
	    repositories for the <em class="wordasword">free</em>
	    software have long since disappeared; but so have almost
	    all of the corporate web sites of the commercial
	    software.</p><p>What is particularly pernicious is that when the
	    owner[s] of a popular and much-used commercial product
	    diversify (or, sadly, die), and it is then sold to another
	    company, the buyers usually knows roughly what they have
	    bought — the first time it happens. But when those buyers
	    are themselves bought, the third owner has less knowledge
	    and interest. By the time it happens again, and maybe
	    again, a once-reputable product is now owned by a
	    manufacturer of children’s toys, and has no idea why it
	    also sells a structured-document editor. <span class="phrase">Let the
	      market decide</span> only works in the textbook
	    economic circumstances of perfect knowledge. In the Real
	    World™ where everything is kept under wraps, nothing is
	    safe.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Hypertext linking</em></span> in the
	    <span class="productname">HyTime</span> sense never took off.
	    The <span class="productname">Panorama</span>-style browsers
	    demonstrated that it was not only possible but easy to
	    use, and anyone who has taught <acronym class="acronym">HTML</acronym> or
	    had to deal with novice designers will know that there is
	    demand for multi-headed and bidirectional links.</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><span class="navprev"><a accesskey="p" href="ar02s03s01.html" shape="rect">Prev</a></span> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="u" href="ar02s03.html" shape="rect">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> <span class="navnext"><a accesskey="n" href="sampledoc.html" shape="rect">Next</a></span></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="h" href="oxygen-main.html" shape="rect">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td></tr></table></div><div class="footer">Generated by<a class="oxyFooter" href="http://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_webhelp.html" target="_blank" shape="rect">
