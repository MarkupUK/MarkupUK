Having chosen
            to build a garden railway, having been trained as an engineer and having read some of the sage advice from those already <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">in the
                scene</span>”</span>, it was clear that the layout would need some careful design. Issues such as maximum gradients, minimum turn radii and
                <span class="emphasis"><em>loading gauge</em></span> clearances required a clear and calculated design. Naturally there are CAD tools specifically
            targetted at model railways, but equally well, I found none of them to be <span class="emphasis"><em>just right</em></span>.</p><p>So, having spent many years developing software, and in recent times being deeply immersed in XML technologies, particularly
                XSLT3.0[<span class="citation">XSLT</span>] and SVG[<span class="citation">SVG</span>], I decided to build a specific design tool with these technologies.
            Given Saxon-JS[<span class="citation">Saxon-JS</span>] as the XSLT execution engine, the tool was run through a browser connecting to a
                <span class="emphasis"><em>localhost</em></span> web server.</p><p>The main design used an XML definition of garden <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">background</span>”</span> and the possible layouts, and at first calculated all the
            resulting geometry, producing both a tabular summary and a set of SVG graphic elements that could be displayed on a grid. This permitted
            for example interferences between tracks and garden elements (e.g. bushes) to be examined. Simple XHTML controls were added to allow
            various aspects of the display to be altered dynamically, using Saxon-JS's interactive modes (e.g. <code class="code">ixsl:on-change</code>) to alter
            style or class properties of parts of the XHTML/SVG DOM tree. Textual styling (fonts, colours. etc.) were defined in a set of CSS
            stylesheets.</p><p>Once a simple system was operational, the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">picture</span>”</span> was enhanced, both by supporting an isometric view of the
            garden/layout, but also more <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">realistic</span>”</span> graphics for the track and other aspects.</p><p>A little experimentation showed that the animation facilities present in SVG should allow objects to move around the paths of the track.
            A simple facility was added to enable <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">block</span>”</span> objects to be run, moving from section to section under controllable and
            alterable speeds. Simple click interaction allowed the points to be changed, so the path of these blocks could be altered whilst they were
            still running.</p><p>The model for these <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">locomotives</span>”</span> was improved to support a three-dimensional definition consisting of a number of
            orthogonal rectangular blocks and cylinders, from which an isometric SVG view of a simple locomotive could be displayed. This would then
            be animated to follow the path of the current track section, with tangential rotation to <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">point forward</span>”</span> and with suitable
            rotation animations on the wheels. Simple sound effects (running sound, whistles etc.) were added to the design.</p><p>Finally, this system was demonstrated at MarkupUK 2018 in the DemoJam session, with some success.</p><p>In this paper I describe the deign and implementation details of the system that was demonstrated, and outline some additional possible
            developments. In conclusion I discuss how suitable the combination of XSLT3, SVG and Saxon-JS has been to tackling this design
            task.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><span class="navprev"><a accesskey="p" href="ar08.html" shape="rect">Prev</a></span> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="u" href="ar08.html" shape="rect">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> <span class="navnext"><a accesskey="n" href="ar08s02.html" shape="rect">Next</a></span></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td><td width="20%" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><a accesskey="h" href="oxygen-main.html" shape="rect">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> </td></tr></table></div><div class="footer">Generated by<a class="oxyFooter" href="http://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_webhelp.html" target="_blank" shape="rect">
