        <p><i>The Organizing Committee</i><br><b>Markup UK 2023</b></p>
        
        <p class="lead">Markup UK and XML Prague Joint Announcement</p>
        <p>The XML Prague and Markup UK conferences have between them provided the markup community with a unique opportunity to meet, learn, and share ideas for many years. Over the last two years, the global pandemic has had a considerable impact on physical conferences – some have had to be cancelled, others have taken place online or in hybrid form. It seems that the winter season will be affected by COVID-19 in the coming years and that it will no longer be a good time of year to hold a conference.</p>
        <p>The organising committees of both conferences have been considering how best to serve the markup community under these new conditions. We are pleased to announce a solution that will enable as many XML experts and users to meet together as possible. From 2022, both Markup UK and XML Prague will be held in alternate years, starting with XML Prague. We are looking forward to meeting you in June 2022 in Prague and in May/June 2023 in London.</p>
        <p>For more information, please see <a href="https://www.xmlprague.cz/">https://www.xmlprague.cz/</a> and <a href="https://markupuk.org/">https://markupuk.org/</a> and the usual social media channels.</p>

        <p class="lead">Steven Pemberton's two-part XForms tutorial, with Part 1 on Friday morning and Part 2 on Saturday morning, requires a small amount of software to be installed.</p>
        <p>While you can follow the tutorial online, you need to download the software (<a href="https://homepages.cwi.nl/~steven/xforms/xforms-hands-on.tar.gz">Gzipped tarball for Linux/MacOS</a> or <a href="https://homepages.cwi.nl/~steven/xforms/xforms-hands-on.zip">zip archive for Windows</a>) to do the exercises yourself.

        <p class="lead">A Clarification Is in Order</p>
        <p>We're NOT going to make any recorded presentations available after the 2021 conference, nor will we keep said recordings. We've been considering prerecording some or all conference presentations after experiencing first-hand the realities of online presentations during the past year, but also because when Markup UK 2021 was still to happen in hybrid format, it was a simple way of ensuring that the show can go on, regardless of last-minute changes to the global situation.</p>

        <p class="lead">2020 Conference Cancelled</p>
        <p>Due to the extraordinary circumstances, we've had no option but to cancel this year's conference.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the ever-increasing risks associated with the widespread coronavirus have led us to a decision that, although appropriate under these unique circumstances, undoubtedly will be disappointing to many. This year's conference has been cancelled and we'll be working towards returning in 2021.</p>
        <p>Those of you who already registered will, of course, be refunded in full.</p>
        <p>Thank you for your interest and support, and please stay safe.</p>
